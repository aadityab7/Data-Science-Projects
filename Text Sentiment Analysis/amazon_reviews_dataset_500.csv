1,"Sprayed orange grease all over the inside of the microwave The pop-up bowl sounds like a great idea, but evidently they rushed it to market before all the bugs were out.<br /><br />The first bag I cooked was fine, except the instructions for opening the bag are far from clear, and even after you figure out how to do it it's a lot of trouble and makes a big mess.<br /><br />But the second bag evidently sprang a leak - it sprayed bright orange grease all over the inside of my microwave, even into the tiny vent holes inside the top and side. I always watch popcorn carefully while it pops, but I could not see the grease spray until after it was done and I opened the door. Cleaning it all out was a horrible ordeal, and I'm sure everything I cook in the microwave will come out smelling like popcorn grease for weeks.<br /><br />They released this product too soon. It needs serious redesign. I will not buy it again."
3,"Had higher expectations It is a naturally sweetened soda with Stevia, but I expect more robust flavor simular to Dr. Pepper.  I wouldn't even say it is close to Dr. Pepper.  I was disappointed, especially when I love the ""Cola"" flavor of Zevia so much."
5,Everything is as it should be I ordered these nuts...for both my own personal consumption...and my two African Greys Scaredy Bird and Reggie.<br /><br />I believe I can speak for all of us in saying that the nuts arrived on time and in delectable condition. They were fresh....and arrived not broken or damaged in any way.<br /><br />Diamond Nuts..has a high reputation with me---and they continue to prove their worth..by sending out a excellent product !<br /><br />I do --highly recommend this company--and this product !
5,"So Happy I found this; Product is Fabulous I decided to stop using sweet n' low for obvious reasons.  I hated the cost of buying the boxes of Splenda in my locale grocery, as it was so expensive.  When I googled Splenda and found this I was elated and ordered it right away.  I will order a second for my home upstate shortly, as I certainly cannot transport this box in an efficient manner  and I need it in my City location."
5,"Great tea, very satisfying Nice mellow tea for all occassions.  I'm an ex-coffee drinker searching for an alternative and this product fit nicely.  It's smooth, very satisfying.  Nice product."
5,"Excellent Tray for Freezing Homemade Food This freezer tray is excellent - I am actually purchasing another - now that the little one is eating more food,<br />I'd like to prepare more at once. Frozen items scoop out easily with a spoon. Easy to clean!"
5,"Great purchase for Multicultural learning. I bought this book for a lesson on Multiculturalism in the classroom.  I incorporated a puppet with the story, and the students loved it.  This is a must for any classroom."
4,"Really unusual gift for a friend My daughter went to Japan and brought back rice and bean paste desserts that each were inside cute paper boxes or baskets.  I found them to be delicious and so did our neighbor's daughter.  So when her birthday rolled around, she asked for these Japanese Tea Cakes.  We were delighted to discover that Amazon sold them and ordered these for her gift.  These are made from bean paste rather than rice.  The cakes were just as delicious as the ones my daughter brought back from Japan.  Highly recommended if you enjoy this sort of treat."
5,Best Litter Ever Used We have had cats for many years and this litter is the best by far of all the brands we tried.<br />I have found one trick to keeping this fom sticking to litterbox bags is to keep the plastic bag smooth on the bottom of box and litter clumps perfect every time.
2,"turkish taffy this taffy is not the same recipe as when I was a child. It is much darker, where the original was snow white . The taste is also different. It has a strong vanilla taste. I wont buy again.My carton came today, and each bar was all broken into small pieces.Very disapointed."
5,"Healthy choice for dog w/ food allergies/sensitive stomach My 8-year old Cocker Spaniel has been on several types of food (Nutro, Iams, Natural Balance, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers Soul, and regular Wellness). She would tolerate each for a short period of time, but then get diarrhea and would vomit. Our Vet suggested we try Wellness Simple Solutions, since it has only one protein and one carb source. We've had her on it for 3 months and she's shown no signs of upset stomach or irritable bowel. We suspect she is sensitive to chicken/chicken by-products, which the Rice and Salmon blend does not contain. The food is expensive, but it's worth the cost to have a healthy dog.....and clean house!"
5,"Works! It Does Depend On The Dog, Though... The Greenies I recently ordered here are working out great, for my dog who needs his thyroid meds.  He's usually pretty eager for any treat, though sometimes a little bit picky -- LOVES these, though.<br /><br />We have another dog that is extremely hard to 'fool' with meds, and Greenies didn't work for her.  So, it does depend on the dog, but Greenies probably work for most."
5,"Very strong , flavorful coffee at a great price They come in bags, I think nitrogen sealed. It is enough to last a week each bag.<br /><br />Flavor: Very bold, very strong but not bitter or acidic. Very much like costco coffee<br />but far more flavorful and complex.<br /><br />Can do a full 10 oz and it is still strong with milk.<br /><br />Less plastic to waste"
4,"C.E.T. enzymatic chews for dogs We are on our 3rd order for these chews for our 2 Scottish Terriers and have been very pleased with the results.  The only thing we dislike is that the price keeps going up.  If this continues, we will not be ordering again!  They work well but don't know if they are worth the price since we have 2 dogs, it gets a little pricey."
5,"sparkling clean dishwasher This product works wonders in my dishwasher. I live in the midwest and we have hard water. My dishwasher began having a white film on my glasses and dishes. The dishes weren't looking clean anymore and the inside of the dishwasher had the film all over. I tried running a cycle with vinegar and that helped some, but I was worried that my dishwasher was going to have major problems. I read about using citric acid cyrstals to remove the film. With no luck at finding citric acid around my area, I ordered it from Amazon. I got it quickly and used it immediately. It took 3 cycles to really remove the film and make my dishwasher look like new. Using the citric acid every couple of weeks keeps my dishwasher sparkling clean."
4,"Delicious! I got Texas BBQ, Garlic, and tomato/garlic flavors. My favorite was BBQ and tomato/garlic ones. I would love to purchase them again!<br />Also, they were pretty filling! :)"
5,Small Breat Board - pretty and useful This product is exactly as described and shown in photo.  It is a very pretty bread (cutting) board that can live out on a counter decoratively.  Nice purchase.
5,Great! I tried this when we went to Scotland and loved it.  I found some in the states at a Scottish festival and bought it on the spot!  Really different that what you get in America - like a Scottish coca-cola with a slight bubble gum flavor. Really reminds me of a great trip!
5,Cadbury Lover Cadbury chocolate is far superior to any american manufactured chocolate!  I put these caramello bars in my brownie batter and they turn into the most delicious carmel brownies ever!! They disappear at every party I bring them too!! I wish the product  was more readily available.
3,"VH choc raspberry truffle k cups recently tried the choc raspberry k cups.  I am not fond of the flavor.  It smells delish, but, definately not enough chocolate flavor for me.  I find that by combining a hot chocolate k cup, along with a bold coffee, I get the desired flavor that I enjoy.  For someone who enjoys a hint of flavor, the VH chocolate raspberry truffle k cups would be excellent. Thank you."
5,"People are always surprised how really good this tea is -- non-caffeine & happens to be healthy to boot. This review is for <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041R1UM0"">Wissotzky Red Tea with Chamomile, Lime & Honey, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> There are other flavors I like very much that I refer to at the bottom of this review. These are all non-caffeine, high antioxidant herbal teas that are always startling delicious to anyone I have served them too.<br /><br />Wissotzky makes a whole range of teas, including those with black tea and those with green tea. The ones I discuss here are my personal favorites.<br /><br />Wissotzky Teas are rather renowned though, personally, I hadn't heard of them until I was teaching at my University's summer law program at University of Haifa in Israel. You pick them up at any supermarket there -- but you have to special order them over here in the US.<br /><br />Having to live in dormitory-style living while teaching over there, the tea was convenient but I was most startled by how really delicious it was. I am not a big tea drinker -- occasionally herbal tea in the winter -- but I was drinking this tea every day during the very hot Israeli summer.<br /><br />I brought quite a bit back with me and ordered more here. I often offered it to colleagues during meetings in my office and they were invariably struck by how unexpectedly delicious it is.<br /><br />So now I give boxes as gifts. And the recipients often hint they wouldn't mind another gift they so love it.<br /><br />Serving the tea at one of my group work meetings has become a hallmark tradition and puts a positive tone as we launch into a 3 hour work session.<br /><br />For more information:<br />These herbal teas are made from the Rooibus (Red Bush) plant from South Africa.<br /><br />The only authentic Rooibus tea is from South Africa -- though many companies claim theirs is Rooibus though not from South Africa.<br /><br />It is not unlike that genuine Champagne can only come from the Champagne region of France but firms market sparkling wines from other regions prepared by the ""Methode Champenoise."" In that case, there are excellent Methode Champenoise sparkling wines that rival genuine Champagne (though being a champagne lover -- I still find a taste unique to genuine Champagne.)<br /><br />However my experience is that non-South African Rooibus Tea is not as good nor does it have the medicinal and homeopathic qualities that genuine Rooibus tea does.<br /><br />As to the variations: Wissotzky sells the pure Rooibus Tea (which does not seem to be here on Amazon) and 3 flavored versions: 1. with Chamomile, Lime & Honey,[[B0041R1UM0 Wissotzky Red Tea with Chamomile, Lime & Honey, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)]] (my and most people's favorite)  2. with Cinnamon & Vanilla <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041R00WG"">Wissotzky Red Tea with Cinnamon and Vanilla, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>(my second most favorite and many people's first choice) and 3. with Rosehip & Passion Fruit <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041R1DYA"">Wissotzky Red Tea with Rosehip and Passion fruit, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> (which I also really like and again is some people's favorites.)<br /><br />As mentioned at the start of this review -- Wissotzky makes a whole range of teas, both with and without flavors, herbal, black tea and green tea (which has its own homeopathic benefits.) I've tried many of the other herbal and enjoy them; I personally stay away from caffeine as my system doesn't handle it well."
5,"A Tasty Snack I have a gluten allergy, so I am always looking for an alternative to cookies, muffins, granola bars, and other sweet snacks that I can no longer eat.  The Kind Bars are great - I have not found any that I absolutely don't like, but some I like better than others.  The Fruit and Nuts in Yogurt is definitely my favorite - I like the combination of nuts, raisins, and yogurt - it does not seem as overpoweringly sweet as some of the others. I originally discovered Kind Bars at Starbucks, but they were VERY expensive to buy on a regular basis. That was when I checked out Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, signed up for the Kind Bars, and cut my purchase cost by more than half - with no shipping cost!  What a cool program - especially for those of us with allergies who need regular access to products that are usually expensive and/or hard to find!"
5,"Healthy & Easy to Cook Wheat Lasagna Shells I highly recommend these whole wheat lasagna shells. (At the risk of selling out). They are super easy to use. No need to pre cook them. They are ready to go straight out of the box. Wholesome and healthy, these taste great as well. I bought the Rozoni Wheat Lasagna pasta, but they are much smaller in width. They took months for Amazon to send them to me as well. I have not tasted those yet, so we will see how they compare in flavor. But these ones are absolutely great. I will be buying more shortly. The Ronzini ones also have to be precooked before hand. Only for five minutes, but still Lasagna takes an hour or so to make as is. Who needs the extra headache? Try these! Great for families. You can cook a bunch and have a meal for a week."
5,"Dogs Love All 3 of my dogs-pom, yorkie, rat terrier, love these. I just received my 2nd order. Wish these were on sub. and save."
2,"Disappointing I am jumping on the bandwagon with all of those reviewers who said this coffee is weak. I am disappointed that the Marley name is on this. I used two of these pods to make two cups of coffee. Yuck! Not only did it taste terrible, but it was incredibly weak. From my standpoint, you would need to use a minimum of two of these per cup of coffee. And that would probably have to be demitasse size to have it taste worthwhile. There also was none of that wonderful coffee aroma that you get with a good coffee.<br /><br />To make matters worse, there are no instructions on the box to tell you how much to use. I wasn't sure if it was my drip coffeemaker or not, but my guess is that the water would have to soak like a teabag. This is a case where you have to sacrifice convenience and go with regular coffee grounds. Not recommended."
3,"pretty good but not the greatest My father drinks a lot of Crystal Light so I decided to get this so I could share it with him. We both thought it was okay but not the greatest. It comes in 5 packs that each makes a big jug of the mix. The color is right for the drink however the taste wasn't like a real margarita. It seemed a bit sweet and watered down to me. You can also taste the articifical sweetner in it.<br /><br />It's a good drink for a non-alcoholic party or get together. Or one of those summer daytime drinks. Otherwise, I'd stick to the real stuff."
5,"Peanut butter with only a quarter of the calories! This stuff is like peanut butter-flavored crack.  You can control how thick or thin you make it, so it's just as perfect to pack in sandwiches without ending up with a gooey mess by noon as it is to drizzle over ice cream.  I usually mix the cocoa flavor with a little chocolate soymilk and eat it right out of the bowl for an indulgent-tasting afternoon snack."
4,"Most versatile crispbread i've tried These have a very small amount of fat - 1% per cracker which must be due to the sesame seeds.<br />It's worth the trade-off because they are actually quite tasty.  The subtle sesame flavor enhances anything you put<br />on them. While low in salt, they taste pretty good right out of the box.<br /><br />Ryvita must be performing some kind of sorcery since they contain no yeast but have an airy crunch, which makes<br />them safer for sensitive teeth.<br /><br />I just ordered a 10 pack in mid July and the expiration date for the batch is December 05.<br /><br />They are very good and I've added them to my subscribe and save list."
4,"Very tasty...but pricey! I discovered these because my daughter's dentist gives them out to his patients (children's dentist). I didn't know anything about Xylitol and was a bit skeptical about it.  So I researched it and learned that it's just a natural sweetner, that's actually good for teeth!  A mother's dream come true!  And they taste really good! I gave it 4 stars, however, because with the outrageous shipping, they are pricey for the amount you get.  The bag these came in is about the size of a medium ziploc bag."
5,"It tastes great!!! I just used this product for the first time, I think it tastes great....like liquid candy!! It's the best tasting sports drink I've ever had. Mine is Cool Citrus. I believe it did help with my workout today, I kept my motivation up and I didn't feel as ""whipped"" afterward. Good stuff. Very cool ingredients too, a lot of research went into this product. BTW, there are 81 servings in there."
1,"I did not like this product I am used to the teas from twinings or other brands from Safeway or other english brands. This tea lacks of good flavor.  One sachet barely makes one cup of tea, whereas twinings and other brands  make 2 cups with full flavor.  I know flavor is a subjective matter, however if you like the flavors of brands like twinings do not buy this brand."
5,"Love this product!! I heard of these through my weight watchers magazine. They a had a $5 coupon code so I figured ""what the heck!"". WOW -- pop chips are amazing - every flavor is AWESOME! I particularly liked the salt & pepper. If you want crunch and flavor - these are for you!!"
5,"One great cup of coffee I've purchased many different K-Cups over the last year or so that I've owned my Keuirg.  I was always looking for that smooth great cup of coffee.  Not too weak, not bitter, not smokey.  Tullys House Blend is smooth and rich.  It's my ""go to"" coffee in the morning.  Ahhhhhh<br /><br />Amazon makes it a great deal purchasing through them.  I make sure I never run out.<br /><br />Love it!"
5,"Great Cookies ! Great Cookies, I really like that they are not only great tasting but chewy and not the usual dry stuff that passes for sugar free with many other brands."
1,"Tasteless Very little taste (weak) and no caffiene that I can tell. I even emailed Tao of Tea about brewing suggestions, and got no reply."
3,too heavy to rise we bought several types of the flour this company has to offer.<br />it will not rise in the bread machine at all.<br />if I mix it with white flour at least half and half it gets a better rise<br />If I make the yeast rise first then mix in the flour mixed with white flour its better yet.<br />not a great flour for bread making. it is a very tasty flour and I make flat breads with it.<br />I will use this flour to mix with white flour bread recipes
5,"Great My dogs just love the food and they look great! Their coats are shiny, no more scratching or itching. I also love the free shipping and price! Don't be afraid to give this a try, your dogs will thank you!!"
5,"GREAT ITEM I have been eating these for over 20 years.  I am a vegetarian,<br />so these are perfect for me to eat.  They are actually a ""vegan""<br />product, so people that a total vegetarians can eat these."
5,"Full body and great afternotes Full body, great flavor and a great cup of coffee. The only coffee my wife will drink. We have tried other Raven's Brew blends but really like Skookum."
5,yay for gummy bears 5 pounds of haribo's best.  love them!  they werent melted when they arrived and i burst out laughing when i realized how much 5 pounds of gummy bears really is.  i recommend once you open the package to break it up into several different zip-loc baggies to keep them fresh.
5,"PB2 rocks A friend who is training for a marathon turned me onto PB2.  Since I couldn't find it in my local stores, I searched and found it through Amazon.  I have ordered both varities, regular and this chocolate peanut butter, twice.  I love both of them, but the chocolate peanut butter is probably my favorite because I feel like I'm having a resees cup.  The product is all natural, no added preservatives.  Just the oil has been extracted leaving the peanut butter in a powder form. I add 1 TBSP to my morning shake, and it's awesome.  I have also hydrated it with a little water, and it's just delicious.  200 calories for 2 TBSP of regular p-butter or 45 calories for 2 TBSP of PB2.  You know what I'm picking.  Try it you'll love it."
5,"Great Flavor I bought this mustard to go with some hard salami, Havarti cheese, and vegetable flavored wheat thins.  We were blown away at how great this tasted.  This stone ground mustard is delicious.  No strong horseradish spice, hint of white wine, and almost a sweet relish texture and aftertaste.  I bought this at the store on a whim and I now discovered my new favorite mustard.  Get some, try it, you'll love it.  Would go great on anything really."
5,"Some really great and some really really bad Diet Cranberry Raspberry - The BEST flavor I've tried yet. It's just sweet enough, great flavor, and calorie free. I always have at least three bottles of this in my cabinet at all times.<br /><br />Orange - Very sweet but good. I'm not a fan of orange soda so that's probably the only reason I don't love this.<br /><br />Lemon-Lime - Again, very sweet. It has a good sprite-type flavor though so I went ahead and tried the diet version as well to see if that would be a staple in our house.<br /><br />Diet Lemon-Lime - It's not an all time favorite but it's good. I have a bottle of this usually for whenever I'm craving something different or something a bit more refreshing and I'm tired of plain water.<br /><br />Cream Soda - WAY too strong. I love cream soda and so I didn't expect any issues with it but just the smell when opening the bottle was enough to make me slightly sick to my stomach. And I'm not exaggerating. I actually threw out the entire bottle after one sip. It has an almost alcoholish undertone to it that doesn't help at all. Gross.<br /><br />Root Beer - Not even close to as bad as the cream soda but slightly reminiscent. I did drink the entire sample that came with the Sodastream but do not plan to buy a bottle of it even though I am a huge fan of root beer.<br /><br />Cola - I bought this to act as an emergency back up for when my husband wanted a rum and coke and didn't have any coke in the house. It tastes a bit like off-brand diet cola to me, probably because of the Splenda. This is very off-putting only because there is so many calories in this and you don't even get a calorie-laden taste. Hahaha. This will continue to be held for those emergencies but we won't be drinking it by itself at all.<br /><br />Grape - This one actually surprised me because I was so prepared not to like it. It's a bit on the sweet side but still much better than many others. I've been putting about 1/4th the amount of syrup in less than called for and it helps cut the sweetness a bit but after that it starts to make the flavor taste watered down. I wish I could find a diet version of this. Not sure if it exists or not but I can't find it on Amazon if it does.<br /><br />I'll update this as I try more. I am cautiously optimistic about the diet ginger ale so that will be my next purchase."
2,"very clean!  sweet nutty taste just to be SURE these were REALLY REALLY CLEAN, i washed a couple of hundred grams very carefully for about ten minutes and then let them dry, and compared them to the same seeds out of the same package without my personal treatment.  they are exactly the same color and consistency, so i would judge that the frontier seeds straight out of the bag do not have any RESIDUE on the exterior of the seed.  lovely, nice, sweet, nutty taste, chock full of serious nutrition (good-for-ya oils and such, pretty sure these are an omega source among other things).  not great for drinks but with baking, i'd go for it.  i snacked on a few after i washed them, as well as drinking the water to be sure it was clean and flavorless, as i expected.  wonderful crunchy stuff.<br /><br />since i'm a little obsessive about getting for the best and freshest quality i can get, i did buy some special somiverum seeds strictly to start my own garden.  I understand they grow quickly so hopefully in another season i'll have my own seed pods and be making the best lemon poppy seed muffins in town.  Time will tell!  yum!!!!!"
5,Big platter This is one of the biggest meat and cheese products that has Quality as well.I got this for my father and he was impressed as well.
5,"GREAT Peanut Brittle The real stuff, GREAT! Unlike what has horribly happened to See's version that I used to love (artificial flavor now and tastes nasty)."
5,"Great Brand! My three cats love this brand of food. The chicken is only the second ""flavor"" I've bought them. Before, I got tuna and they loved it! They seem to love this just as much. This cat food lasts my cats much longer than more popular brands, despite the fact that they have ""free food"" and are constantly eating it. It took them two weeks to finish a 6lb bag, so I'm expecting this 11lb bag to last them nearly a month. When that's taken into account, along with the sheer fact that it's so healthy for them, it makes the price of it very worth it. I'm going to try to continue to buy this for my cats."
5,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT I bought this item for my elderly  Mom, to use with the new Keurig Coffee machine I purchased for her. SHE LOVES IT!!!!!!......I WILL BE ORDERING MORE!!!!!!!!"
5,"This is How Chocolate Bars SHOULD be A luscious layer of ""caramel"" sandwiched between two velvety smooth layers of fine raw cacao.  As soon as you bite into this bar you'll be captivated by the contrasting textures and flavors that compliment each other to perfection.  Comes complete with nutrients and a long lasting energetic mood lift.  The wondrous world of raw vegan food just got a little better."
2,My son didn't like it My son is six and he liked it at first but after a few more drinks he said it's kind of nasty. I tried it and didn't like it either. It tastes like baby food.
4,"Great Price, Not what I was hoping for though. There's the original Tang. There's the fruition Tang that was around from 2008 to 2010, which had extra vitamins (B,D,A, etc.) and replaced half the sugar with zero calorie sweeteners. But tang has gone back to a flavor more similar to the original with full sugar content. I was hoping for the fruition version, which other reviewers received."
5,"White Tea This tea is very good. It has a light flavor to it. I find myself drinking it all day and I feel healthier, not as tired as I usually am."
5,BEST TEA - TRY IT WITH LEMON - EXCELENT TEA AND COSTUMER SEVICE- FASY DELIVERY ALSO BEST TEA - TRY IT WITH LEMON - EXCELENT TEA AND COSTUMER SEVICE- FASY DELIVERY ALSO
4,"Just like I remember as a kid, but more affordable on Amazon! With the subscribe and save option I can get these Cocktail Pep Sticks delievered to my home every 3 months. An 8 pack lasts me a while as I try not to eat them daily, even tho they are so good its hard to restrain myself! These are much cheaper on Amazon than in my local store, so I often look to Amazon for beef jerky type purchases."
3,"Middle of the road I've been using water enhancers for a couple of years and I started with the powdered varieties that had to be stirred up to dissolve.  I then began using Mio when it came out.<br /><br />""Vitamin Squeeze"" takes the enhancer game a step higher, by adding vitamin C, caffeine, and taurine.  It touts itself as an ""energy drink"", but I honestly didn't feel any bump in energy when I used it.  It has about half the caffeine of a cup of coffee.  The fruit punch flavor is tolerable, but has a ""chemical"" after taste - it's difficult to get artificial fruit flavors right and this could use some work.  The artificial colors and flavors remove it from the ""healthy"" category.  ""Vitamin Squeeze"" also requires refrigeration after it's been opened which is a little inconvenient for me at work, but not necessarily a deal breaker.  The flavor isn't overly intense; one squeeze gives a hint of fruit punch flavor but if you like a stronger flavored beverage, a lot more than one squeeze will be needed.<br /><br />All in all, it's a passable water enhancer, but I wouldn't want to rely on it as a vitamin source or even as an energy drink."
5,My son loves this! My 8 month old loves this. So happy to see the teachers at day care reports that he eats most of this whenever I pack this for him
5,"Best Popcorn Ever This was the sweetest, smallest, hulless, best tasting white popcorn I have ever had.  Just placed an additional order for a 6 lb. bag as well as other varities carried by this company."
5,Zico I am training for a marathon and was having trouble with cramping. In the past i had only used gatoraid and that was not stopping the cramps.I had tried Zico in other flavors but chocolate is the only one I can tolerate. I actually love the chocolate. Since using it after runs over 90mins. I no longer get cramps. It is best cold. I also mix it into my smoothie as a recovery drink. I order it by the case now since my grocery store does not always have it and I don't want to run out.
5,"perfect for everything These tomatoes are perfect for everything. I use them for pasta salads, soup base, pasta sauces, and the list goes on and on. You can put them on top of toasted bread for a unique bruschetta if you want. I have tossed them in scrambled eggs and thrown cheese on top for a quick and yummy omelet. Highly recommend these tomatoes. They are fire roasted and seasoned perfectly. Use subscribe and save for the best deal."
1,"Non-existent Cashews but lots of Dates The bar has almost no cashew but lots of dates. The bar should be labeled ""Almond Date Bar."" The label is misguided."
5,"Arizona Green Tea @ It's Best... Best Product I have found in a long time. This Canister holds Six tubs that makes 2 Quarts of the Best Green Tea Ever!  I was so happy to find it in the convenient Tubs for travel or at home.  Finding it in the Stores was terrible, so when I found it on ""Amazon"" at such a great deal I could not pass it up! The Canister is sealed and each tub is sealed by them self...so they do stay fresh.<br />They make them in different flavors & have Sugar-Free which I could not find in any store.  Even if you are not a Arizona Tea drinker you will be very surprised how good this product taste...Once you get these you will be on the Auto order before you know it."
5,"So Hard To Find I love this chicken base! It works so well with my soups, gravies and anything elso I need to make a broth for.  Taste is excellent.  Spent about 20 hours searching the web to find it! Finally found it at Amazon !"
3,"Tastes like hot water When I drink this, it tastes like flavored hot water. I think the powdered stuff you add water to that you get in the grocery store tastes way better. Won't be ordering this again."
3,"Just ""Average"" Well, I purchased these thinking they'd be larger. It's a great price for 500 bags, but they're really pretty small. They can't hold more than about 25 jumbo popcorn pieces at a time. They're a little easy to rip and they just don't sit quite right, the bottom doesn't expand to make the bag a full rectangled shape as you'd expect. Weird, but affordable."
2,Hmmmm tiny but cute.. lol Got what looked like a nice size bonsai and well.. If its four years old.. then its the smallest bonsai I have ever seen ..It must have only grown.. a quarter inch a year..Its like a little twig in a pot ..but suppose its ok..We will see.. Anyway got it in the mail..usps .. and its here..Its nice if you like little itty bitty plants.. but I suppose I was expecting something bigger.
4,"So much better than the nibs. This is much easier to consume than the nibs. It also leaves out that bitter taste. I use a table spoon and blend it with milk, bananas and strawberries. Tastes great and makes a quick and healthy breakfast."
5,"need it! I bring these to work. My job is in retail, and we all have our water bottles. No one has these! So everyone knows that little bottle is mine. Not to mention that the water quality is lovely, and the cost per bottle is much less that buying bottles of water, one by one. Get a case delivered to you door, and that's it!"
5,"Just like the original I finally conceded that my children prefer Kraft amac and cheese to any kind of home made. I usually pick the whole grain variety, but this is just as good and with a different added nutritional hit."
2,flavor let down Although the flavor is good it doesn't last very long.  After the flavor leaves the gum is unpleasant to chew.
5,K-cup asssortment We had just received a Keurig and thought this assortment would be a good way for us to taste several different coffees and then decide which ones we liked best. It's a nice assortment - a little pricey but an excellent opportunity to sample.
5,I love this cereal! It's been my favorite cereal since I was a kid.  It's so hard to find these days in stores.  I always look and am always disappointed.  So glad to find it here and at such an good price!  Also glad I can subscribe and save and not go to the supermarket to get cereal =)
4,"helped with my dry scalp skin I will be another who admits that I didn't realize that this inexpensive oil was intended for non Caucasian folks and that it mostly contained mineral oil and in both cases, Im glad that I didn't because this is a good product for me.  I have dry skin and my scalp is no exception.  I put a little of this oil both on my scalp and on the ends of my hair, wait 20 minutes, then wash it thoroughly.  After drying my hair, I put s tiny amount in my palms and rub it on my ends.  My scalp has stopped flaking and it seems to hold down frizzies very well too.  I will continue to use it and am glad i found it."
5,"A big help We found out that my daughter had a suspected cow's milk allergy shortly after her 1st birthday. I had never used formula and tried to supplement my diminishing milk supply with cow's milk since she was now 1 and found out she was allergic with a 2AM ER trip. The pediatrician prescribed Neocate jr, but that was such a pain since it isn't sold in stores. I bought one of these when the Neocate jr hadn't arrived on time and she loved it and began sleeping better right away, so I then bought it by the case. I think her allergy was much less severe than we had suspected. She is now 2 and does great with Lactose free cow's milk."
4,"coffee Tastes fine.  It is the cheapest way I can find to ""feed"" my Senseo coffee maker.  At $0.44/mug it is not that ""cheap"" but it is good.  They are cheaper in Europe."
5,"Awesomely delicious! Love Cliff bars, but have only liked the Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chip Peanut Crunch flavors (maybe an occasional Blueberry).  The others are too sweet for my taste.  These are my new favorite.  Great taste combination.  Go Cliff Bars!"
5,Yuban Dark Roast Great Coffee at a great price.I normally ground it finer and use a percolator which makes it taste better than the regular coffee machines.<br />Too bad amazon stopped selling this item
5,"Worked great in regular recipes We used these crumbs to make pie crusts for Thanksgiving.  The results were excellent!  Taste and texture were just like regular graham cracker crumbs.  We were able to make 2 no-bake crusts from one box, making them cost-effective as well."
5,Fleshtone I have not used this Gel Paste yet but I can't wait to try it out. . . . .
5,"fantastic! I have been looking for gluten free plain crackers for ages. Being pregnant, all I wanted in my first trimester was some plain crackers, but I thought I had no options being Celiac; there's some nice rice crackers out there, but they all are flavored with onion, garlic, BBQ, etc- not things you want during pregnancy! I found these recently in a local (high end) grocery store and was so happy to see ""plain"". I tried them and I had to laugh at myself for getting so excited over plain crackers. They are super good, with by themselves, or with butter, cream cheese, etc. They are great for soup as they are full of flavor and have a crispy taste. They are also not high in salt like most other crackers. Great buy too, I highly recommend if you, like me, just want some nice crackers without the salty ""flavor"" added to them."
1,"Goji berries I am so disappointed, these berries have a very bad aftertaste. I got a little nauseous after eating about an ounce...kinda makes me worry...Im going to try them for a few more days if i get nauseous one more time im going to attempt to return...One very odd thing...i didnt get any paperwork w/ this order, so returning may be a huge hassle..."
4,"Hot, but not TOO hot! The chili pepper spices up this olive nicely. On a ""hot scale"" of 1 to 10 this pepper stuffed olive is probably a 6 in hotness. Good product."

5,An excellent hot or cold beverage! This tea was very deliciuos.You can brew it hot with a little sweetener or leave it to chill and serve over ice.It tastes equally good either way and has that nice non-caffeine refreshing effect.
5,Amazing and addictive Can't get enough of these.  I think they just converted my vegetarian daughter!  Think I'll have to hide them from her.
5,"Beans on Toast Heaven! I introduced my American husband to beans on toast.  He loves them, but until we found out that Amazon would send us Heinz beans we had to settle with the few cans I could put in my suitcase or the few times I would find them at the super market.  Now we only have to control ourselves to how many times we have Beans on Toast each month. The Beans are winning!"
5,"Ah Sugar........ Ah Honey Honey...... I just want to state one thing before I begin. It has been said in certain circles that as a quid pro quo for endorsing a product, the manufacturer provides your beloved Seer with generous monetary kickbacks. Nothing could be further from the truth. Yes, I know that I gave into weakness many reviews ago and was supposed to get a kickback from that deodorant manufacturer. But the check bounced and some new Federal law went into effect preventing me from blatant profiteering. Well. at least my underarms don't offend anyone.<br /><br />As most of you know, by reading my online bio, I need to jump start my day with a few cups of coffee. The jumping cables are hooked up straight from the coffee cup to my ears (the left ear is the negative side) and I get that special ""buzz"" that allows me to write my ever-evolving reviews and lectures.<br /><br />But as I travel throughout the world, many heads of state ask me ""would you like sugar with that good, kind, generous, selfless Metamorpho"". I tell them no. Why? Because I have found a sugar subsitute that works better for me. Yes. It's equal!<br />I trained most countries to have it ready when I arrive (although Cuba and Venzuela have refused thus far). Anyway, equal comes in these nifty little packets that are easy to rip open and pour. Each one is ""equal"" to about a teaspoon of regular sugar (or so my tastebuds have surmised). I have been using it for years and have had no after effects. In fact, it has been instrumental in the growth of my third eye. All apprentice seers should know this.<br /><br />There is no bitter aftertaste either. I really hate it when I'm in a restaurant and have to settle for sweet n low. I tell ya people, it ruins the whole dining experience. One word of caution for all you aspiring Betty Crockers out there. Do not, I repeat, do not try to bake with equal. It does not do well being heated. Unless you want that gingerbread man to taste like flatbread, I would avoid using it.<br /><br />Equal works very well with all flavoured coffees and tea. It's also an ingredient thats found in all your favorite sodas. So, try it soon. Let me know. Your customer satisfaction survey will be arriving shortly.<br /><br />Another stirring review by -- Metamorpho ;)"
5,"Doggie dessert My dog adores these! They are more dense than the usual dog treats yet not as chewy as rawhide. Though the chew appears dark in color, the color does not rub off only to carpet while the dog is chewing--as some flavored rawshide chews do. They are high in protein, anti-oxidant, and healthy for the teeth. An 8.5 ounce package contains six bones about the size of a chicken drumstick bone."
5,Bravo Volpi Never tried Volpi Salami before but took a chance with this 5-bundle package. No dissappointment here - each one seemed better than the other!
1,Is this bag on the recall list? I purchased this bag of dog food and then broke it up into smaller containers for freezing. I then threw the bag out.<br /><br />Now some of the bags have been recalled. I do not have the lot numbers I need to determine if my bag is on the list.<br /><br />Please forward that information as soon as possible. Thank you.
5,"Excellent Product I have tried many different types of protein drinks, and this is certainly the best one out there.  It has the best taste and the best list of ingredients.  They should bring back the Amazon Subscribe and Save option for this product."
5,Coco loves these! I give my dog one of these every day.  She loves them as the toy keeps her busy.  This 75 pack is a real bargain.
5,Cinnamon Good In my area one cannot find Cinnamon Mentos.  I am so happy I was able to find this flavor.  I just love this product.
1,"""new"" Cheesoning tastes terrible We have been using Reeses Cheesoning for about 15 years and buy it by the case. I was so excited to find it on Amazon but super disappointed when we tried it and it is absolutely not the original. I checked the ingredients and there are a few changes that unfortunately changed the flavor dramatically. I HATE it and too bad I bought 2 cases. Oh well you live and you learn. i will contact Reeses to see if I can recoup some of my loses."
5,"Pass The Test! My son loves it. I think it's his favorite out of the three brands of baby food we've tried. You can't beat the packaging, very convenient."
5,"Yummy gluten-free cookies, great price! My husband has to have gluten-free food and he LOVES these cookies.  The problem was they were pretty expensive at our grocery store.  Now that we get them on Amazon they are 1/2 price!!!"
5,Yummy and Saves Munny. Arrived quickly and was well packaged.  Price is much less than the mass produced honey at the big-name grocery stores.  And this honey tastes great!
5,"Tasty Fiber in a gummy? You bet! I'm a huge fan of Vitafusion products because they taste good and make taking vitamins really easy, if not, enjoyable--it's almost like eating candy without the guilt. The only draw back is potentially eating too much of it, so I would keep it away from children. Like other fiber products, eating excess can cause gas or upset stomach. There is also a regular version that is not sugar free, so if you are not too concerned about sugar, you have that option too. Personally the sugar free and regular versions taste pretty similar so no big deal either way. Overall, a good buy especially if you want to increase your fiber intake without the hassle or unappetizing of traditional powders, pills, and drinks."
5,"They didn't all make it to the lunchbox I purchased these as a treat for my kid's lunchbox. She loves they dayglow yellow puffs. She liked these better. Sadly, so did I. : )"
5,"These do  the trick! Great way to limit the amount of dry food your cat eats in one sitting as he/she needs to work to get his/her food out.<br /><br />Plus, it provides a bit of a challenge to them, therefore combatting having a bored kitty - a large problem with indoor cats."
4,"I like that it's grain-free, but it's awfully expensive I know that grain-based foods are bad for cats. In the wild, they eat meat, not wheat.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Wellness kitten food is about 1.5 times more expensive than the mainstream, grainy kitten foods, and i just can't afford to use it as my primary food.<br /><br />My cats haven't had any trouble so far with the other foods i get, so it's not that i need to buy this one to avoid investing in a carpet steamer. I'd prefer to use it more, for their long-term health, but... it's just not viable."
5,"Tasty and versital First, it is Paul Newman. The Parmesan and roasted garlic is great on a salad.I've put it on chicken and marinated beef strips with it. My family also likes it over steamed vegetables. I'm going back for more! Meals have gone to humdrum to fab!"
4,"shake diet Okay, I bought this product to do a shake diet. Instead of two scopes, I use one unless I was going to exercise, then I use two scoops. This is real good. I use water for my shakes so it won't be more calories. If you ever decide to do a shake diet, just know you're going to piss it off if you use water, milk have you on the toilet so it's best to do the water. I love this product! I've bought it two times and I've dropped off 20 pounds just doing a shake diet.<br /><br />Do one scoop [do two scoops thirty minutes to an hour before going exercising]<br />Do this every hour [you can have two solid meals but don't go over 250 calories, and no drinking shakes or eating after 8]<br />Use water instead of milk<br /><br />That's how I did it and I lost a lot. I would have gave it five stars but the price went up. When I first bought this product, I paid twenty-five dollars and some cents. Now it's almost thirty dollars. They need to go back down on the product. But if you're not doing a shake diet and just use this for workouts and stuff, I don't know how it's going to work you. Well I do know when you workout, you going to feel it like with any other workout but the next day, you will not be sore. That's why I love it. When I'm exercising, I feel the burn, the pain. I even feel it once I'm done but later that day or the next day, the pain is gone! If you buy this product, you'll love it! Great taste too if you know what you're doing."
2,Overpowering Smell This cream is more for normal to oily skin rather then dry/mature skin.  It goes on nicely and gets absorbed quickly.  It leaves a nice smooth feel on your skin like the more expensive creams do.  However this cream has an overpowering sweet jasmine smell.  The smell does not fade.  People will only smell your face cream.  This could be used as face cream/cheap perfume. I thought I can get used to the smell but it's too strong and rather unpleasent.
4,"Dog gives it 5 stars Got this for my dog as the vet advised that she go on a low-protein/low-phosperous diet to maintain kidney health. Dog LOOOVVVVESSSS it, but don't sniff the can, just trust that it smells bad, and keep your nose away!!! Otherwise, you WILL have regrets!!!!<br /><br />Would give this a 5-star except that it doesn't outline how much regular dogfood to feed with it. I'm having to play by ear."
5,Professional cyclist My husband was a pro cyclist and swears by Cytomzx it is always his drink of choice for long rides.
5,"Pets deserve good food too. Why didn't I realize sooner that the animals I love deserve food that is wholesome and nutritious?  I recently switched to a top quality dry cat food which I give to our 3 cats daily, but I supplement that with canned ""wet"" food every 2nd or 3rd day.  The cats have adjusted to this new feeding method and really like their new foods.  Newman's Own Organic Chicken and Wild Rice is a fine product and I've ordered it through Amazon's subscription program so that it is sent to me on the interval that works best, and shipping is free.  A very great deal all around."
3,"too expensive total ripoff, go to a near by indian store and u get the same or 99cents.its  also called methiseeds"
1,"Stale Bitter Flavor My grandma buy these HUGE plastic bins full of Folders ground coffee. Puroast tastes like the very last pot she makes from a plastic bin - weak, stale and bitter. My daughter is coffee connoiseur, so I gave her a cup, she took a sip and asked me where I managed to find such low quality coffee.<br /><br />Going wihout coffee is better than drinking this."
4,This is very good! Not much of a coffee drinker but this Wolfgang Vienna brand is good. Not strong but a mellow taste.  The flavored coffees are getting on my nerves and this is just a good everyday coffee flavor. Everyone in the family and visitors like it. Would buy again.
5,"Tasty & Easy I bought a package of these in Amish country and had them with vegetable soup a couple nights ago. My husband, son and I all thought they were excellent. It made six so we all had two and wished we had bought more, so I saved the envelope in order to look them up was glad to find them here on Amazon today. Ordering more now. They are better than the frozen ones from Schwann's but of course, not quite the same as Red Lobster's.<br />All you do is add water and drop from a spoon - couldn't be easier. Nice addition to any meal."
5,"HOW SWEET IT IS! This is a great product - adds sweetness and vanilla flavoring to coffee, yogurt, anything you like! Have also sprinkled this on berries for added pizaaz. Try it - if you love vanilla - you'll like it!"
5,"Love The Different Colors These bags work great, and it's nice to have the different colors to look at for a change. I also love that they are biodegradable."
1,"Bitter, Burned Flavor. Major Aftertaste. With the first sip, you can taste the bitter, burned nut flavor in this Gloria Jeans k-cup.  Top it off with a major aftertaste (cream & sugar didn't help) & this blend went straight to the bottom of my list.<br /><br />If you want a nice hazelnut coffee, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IRGDFW"">Millstone Coffee, Hazelnut Cream, 12-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 3)</a>."
3,"What's wrong with your packaging? I ordered FOUR cases of these juicy juices.  When I opened the packaging, I was horrified to find that many of them had burst open and spilled the juice everywhere.  Now I only have 119 apple juice boxes instead of 128. I'll never have enough to bathe in a kiddie pool with.  Plus it looks like I peed all over my floor. My life is ruined, and I'm probably going to start drinking again because of this.  It's the end of the world.<br /><br />P.S batman sucks"
5,My cat loves this stuff Over the past 2 weeks I've been transitioning my 10 month old cat from dry to wet food. This is the only wet food that he really eats with enthusiasm. I really think it helped in the transition. We've also tried Wellness Core and EVO (also high quality foods) but he likes this stuff the best.
5,best in the world Nabisco's original saltine crackers are the best in the world. Please make them available in Germany!!!!
5,"Better than most restaurant indian food Stop reading reviews and just buy this.  Look at it as an investment in your home cooking palate.  I live in NYC and am a huge authentic curry fiend, been all over testing all the local places, as well as some not-so-local places (been to india, loved it)...this curry rivals or exceeds the quality of the food you'll find in a restaurant.<br /><br />Making this is the easiest thing in the world: cut up meat, empty packet and water into pot, cook for a few hours, enjoy.<br /><br />This should be made with regular lamb shoulder or even blade chop meat, cooked for 2 hours or more, with less water than recommended, and then a little bit of light coconut milk added at the end to thicken up the curry.  A little rice or naan and you're all set."
5,"My favorite Tea!!! No other Raspberry compares!!!! My favorite tea is raspberry flavor and I have tried every one I have found in the stores. This one is by far my favorite! The flavors are so sweet and I have been able to give up coffee for this one! This is a great price too if you buy two 6-packs you save the shipping. At my local store I can get this tea for $0.15 per bag but on here it works out to $0.11 per bag, which would save me $9.60 on that amount of bags."
5,"Best (and easiest) Bread Ever! This has to be the best and easiest bread machine mix I've come across.  Incredibly simple directions and impossible to fail.  Plus the loafs come out perfect everytime (I've had issues in the past with getting whole wheat flours to rise as well as white flours).  I've purchased this ""collection"" several times and will continue to do so."
2,Guinea pig food This organic protein tastes so bad that I think its meant for you to not want to eat ever again... but I guess it's good for you?
5,"delicious. I'm picky about my green teas. Sometimes they're too weak, sometimes it just doesn't smell/taste like green tea, or sometimes it's just horribly bitter/sour and unpalatable (think most grocery store teas).<br /><br />But Stash's green tea is TERRIFIC. There's a good element of leafyness (it IS green after all) without much bitter/sourness. I can usually pull at least 2 good cups of hot green tea from each tea bag.<br />I was actually previously disappointed by Yogi's Green tea (it's just purely green tea leaves, can't remember the exact name of it though) - when steeped in hot water it smelled like burnt tires, so I almost lost hope in American grocery store teas. I previously would only buy the Yamamotoyama green teas (slight roasted flavor) and Stash's green tea tastes remarkably similar, which makes me incredibly happy due to the Stash tea sales that have been going on at my local markets. WOO!!!"
1,"Produces through torture You might want to check youtube to see how foie gras is obtained before you buy it.  It is obtained through torture. The ducks and geese are violently force fed an incredible amount of food until their liver becomes diseased, engorged and fatty.  This is extremely painful and cruel."
2,"Frustrated Dog Great idea, but my fido is so frustrated he lays there and crying and barking hoping the treats will fall out.  Still working on training him, but not sure this is good for his psyche.  He'd much rather unscrew the bottom if he could."
5,"Totally Addictive Popcorn! I discovered this popcorn not long ago and then found<br />I could not eat any other popcorn. I stumbled upon it<br />in my grocery store so thought, why not try a bag-<br />famous last words!  I then had to get 2, 3 and more<br />bags at a time. If you find them tasting a little stale<br />(altho I cant imagine having them long enough to become<br />stale!), the company told me to just put them in the<br />freezer! Put popcorn in the freezer? Sounded a bit daffy<br />to me but it does work.  Good buy."
3,"Taste is individual I LOVE dark chocolate so when I saw the reviews of this kind I figured I'd give it a try.  Now taste is a matter of individuality so I'll give you the difference in this Belgian Dark Chocolate by Stephen's and my usual Nestle Rich Chocolate:<br /><br />Belgian:150 calories per serving,  serving is 3Tlb mix and only 3/4 cup water or milk.<br />vs<br />Nestle: 80 calories w/water per serving, serving is 2Tlb mix and a WHOLE cup of water.<br /><br />Belgian: Total Fat 3.5g,  Sodium 240mg, Total Carbs 27g, Sugars 22g, Protein 2g<br /><br />Nestle: Total Fat 3g, Sodium 170mg, Total Carbs 15g, Sugars 12g, Protein 1g<br /><br />I first mixed the Belgian mix as directed but couldn't finish it due to the fact that it was just too sweet for me.  It IS creamy, but just too sweet.  When I use the Nestle I only use 1/2Tlb and a squirt of dark choc. syrup and I'm happy with that.  So I then mixed the Belgian as I do with the Nestle and it's ok.  I can't rave about it due to the fact that it's higher in sugars and sodium than the Nestle and if you are trying to watch those things you might want to take that into consideration.<br />To me dark chocolate shouldn't be as sweet(or sweeter) as milk chocolate, I'm sure that's why I prefer dark chocolate.  I'll even add some unsweetened chocolate powder to my mix at times.<br /><br />But as I've said it's all in your individual taste, I just wish they would have listed the Nutrient Facts along with their ingredients.<br />Not bad, just not all that great if you don't like REALLY sweet hot chocolate."
5,Love all Davidson's Herbal Teas Can't beat the price and it's nice herbal tea.  I was and still am a coffee drinker but have been enjoying herbal teas of late.  Hard to beat Davidson's teas.
4,"THE SWITCH The Switch, is a refreshing carbonated juice, with no added sugars or preservatives.  It is a good replacement for sugary sodas.  It taste a little like a cross between sparkling water, Faygo pop, and fruit juice, with a surprisingly good flavor and refreshing fizz.  It is a little costly, about 96 cents for an 8.3 fluid ounce can.  However, the extra money you spend on The Switch, you might just save in dentist bills."
5,"Sexxy Cougar Man It's the drink you want, at a price you can afford.<br /><br />And I was alarmed with how meticulously packaged it came.<br /><br />You will be pleasantly surprised and happy to be drinking Orangina wherever you are.<br /><br />And maybe, just maybe, you may get a sexxy cougar man. :)"
5,"Best for the best My ""royal"" minature dachshund deserves the best but it gets expensive. Now I can not only give her what she deserves, your pricing and free shipping make it so easy."
5,fave This is one of my favorite sauces to have handy. With this order you get two giant bottles which should last a while. The taste of this is perfect! Not for the faint of heart however...
5,"Wonderful- in nutrition and value! As someone who uses honey regularly in baking and cooking as a replacement for traditional refined sugar, I was on the hunt for the best honey nutritionally at the best value. I am confident that this is it. Not only is the honey delicious and meets the criteria I was looking for (heated at a lower temp to preserve enzymes), but it is much cheaper when purchasing through Subscribe & Save than repeatedly buying raw/natural honey at a health food store. I am very pleased and highly recommend this buy!"
5,the best cookie ever I had Tim Tams while traveling in Australia & New Zealand this summer.  This is the best cookie you will ever eat. I highly recommend it***
3,"Not what I expected. The popped corn was very small and didn't seem to have a lot of corn flavor,  Ok, but dissappointing."
4,"Real White Tea White tea is not for everyone. Not because some will find the flavor objectionable, but because it's expensive, particularly if its genuine, and the flavor is mild and very subtle.  This is a meditative tea, not something to be used as an everyday drink to accompany food.  Not that is can't be consumed that way, but the subtle flavors of white tea will be like so much hot water if all it is doing is washing down food.<br /><br />Some will find it to be almost without taste while others will delight in a series of flavor notes that will not smack you over the head but can be pretty wonderful.<br /><br />White tea is made from very select tea leaf tips and might be described as ""beyond green."" Indeed, if you're turned off by green tea's vegetative taste you may love white tea.<br /><br />If you're going to spend money on white tea you should make sure that you buy the real thing and Dilmah is one of my trusted suppliers.  I've loved their Ceylon teas for years, originally ordering them direct from Sri Lanka before they were available for direct sale in the U.S.<br /><br />Experiment with the balance between water and tea and with steeping times to get what you like.  It's worth the price and effort for serious tea drinkers."
5,"My brother in law got these for me My brother in law got these for me.  He instantly rose in esteem.  These are by far the best chocolates on the market in the U.S.  Godiva seems like Hersheys in comparison.  I was used to to mixed Leonidas collection (white and mild), but the dark chocolate is heaven and even better."
3,"A soup with lots of veggies but the smokiness is a bit too much for me I'm a huge fan of Amy's products and was excited to try Amy's Organic Fire Roasted Southwest Vegetable Soup. Like most of the Amy's line, the manufacturer does not skimp on the important ingredients.  This soup is chock full of vegetables. It is thick and has a nice texture and vegetable diversity. While the soup is heavy on vegetables and lighter on broth, the broth that is in the soup is somewhat oily. (This tends to be an issue with many Amy's soups save their chili options and a couple of pureed vegetable options).<br /><br />So why the three stars?  It comes down to personal preference.  My problem with the soup is attributable to one ingredient and that is the chipotle pepper. Chipotle pepper can add a smokey component to foods and it was definitely present with the Fire Roasted Southwest Vegetable.  I had hoped that the chipotle essence would be subdued given its low spot on the ingredient list, but it wasn't.<br /><br />This is a filling soup and when paired with a slice of crusty bread, you have a meal.  Adding some brown rice would yield an even more filling soup for the more hearty appetite.  I did not find the soup to be hot but for reference I eat a lot of spicy Indian curries.<br /><br />This is a vegan product.<br /><br />Ingredients: Filtered water, organic tomatoes, organic roasted potatoes, organic fire roasted corn, organic black beans, organic fire roasted onions, organic carrots, organic fire roasted bell peppers, organic celery, organic green chilies, organic extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, chipotle peppers, spices, organic black pepper, organic onions, organic balsamic vinegar.<br /><br />I purchase Amy's Kitchen soups at my local co-op for about 2.50 a can.  If your store does not carry this and you only want to try one can, consider iherb.com.  You can use my code LEK375 for a discount."
5,Nantucket rocks! This is a very good coffee.  I can drink it black (which is very rare for me) or with the usual cream and sugar.  It is very hard to find a good coffee that you can just drink black and enjoy it.
5,"Perfect taste combination! I fell in love with these delightful candies when a friend brought them back from a trip to Germany. A perfect combination of hazelnut chocolate, cream, and crispy wafer. They are adorably cute as they resemble little hippos. I'm not a big fan of chocolate, but this is a wonderful flavor combination and a tasty little treat."
5,"Tasty comfort food I bought this for a friend who had gone to Minnesota for a family reunion. All she talked about before the trip was buying some wild rice from Minnesota. Well, it just didn't turn out that way for her so long story short, I ordered this for her for a surprise. She made the soup recipe on the box and treated me to it. All I can say is YUMMY!!!  Great product, my only regret is that I did not order a larger size! The rice is hearty and delicious!"
5,"Great flavor! These are my favorite flavor of Maruchan ramen noodles. Keep in mind that these are not at all intended to taste like American chili. These are chili flavored, as in chili peppers--a spicy flavor. They are reat for lunches at work, though low in nutritional content, they are super-cheap. Eat one package with half the seasoning packet and a daily multi-vitamin and you're set! So many people at my work order fast food every day for lunch. You'll save hundreds of dollars by trying these noodles instead. Rotate them with other tasty, inexpensive meals and you have a great, economical solution to daily lunches."
1,"Organic Valley White 1 % Milkfat Lowfat Milk, 8-Ounce Pack of 12 Organic Valley White 1 % Milkfat Lowfat Milk, 8-Ounce Carton (Pack of 12)<br /><br />Not that good. The high price is a rip off."
3,"Cheaper to buy at Home The product is fine - we buy this dog food anyway, but we found it's cheaper for us to buy it right in our home town."
5,"Himalayan course salt I have never ordered sea salt before. i thought this was great. I was afraid it would have some additional flavor that I wouldnt like. Instead it was fresh tasting & natural. I like the pink color, but glad it doesnt come out pink."
5,"Love 'em I'm 63 and have enjoyed Corn Nuts for years but have had trouble finding them.  I finally found them at Walmart but there was never enough for a week!  Finally, I did a web search and found them at Amazon.  I was very pleased to see a steady shipment so  I will never run out again.  Thank you Amazon!"
5,"Yummm! I selected the Plato treats due to the natural ingredients. Wow, my pug Ponch LOVES them! I currently have a bag each of the duck, salmon and chicken. When we get home from our walk he runs straight to the kitchen and runs in circles waiting by the fridge for his treats! These are the only treats I'll buy."
2,Its okay Tried this coffee for the first time when I got it from a friend. Nope. Not going there again. I found it too bitter and it tastes like its namesake.
2,"Not Tasty for my Dog These days it is not easy to find US made dog natural treat with relatively low price, and having treated my 3 year old Westie long time with Healthy Partner beef/turkey strips, I gave Zuke's a try; yet as soon as I opened the bag, I knew that my dog would not like it; it dosen't look good or smell good and I don't even like to taste it, how my dog would like it ?"
5,"Peach Tea - the best tea ever Iced or hot, you can't get a more flavorful tea.  It is ""peachy"", but tastes tropical to me as well.  My whole family likes this particular flavor the best.  I'm so happy to find it here!"
5,"Great Option for a Healthy Snack! I have never had sardines before, and wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised by these. The sardines are firm and meaty, the flavor is great and the olive oil helps keep them moist and easy to swallow. Highly recommend!"
1,"Recalled DO NOT BUY The FDA announced that Candy Dynamics is recalling some of its Toxic Waste brand candy. Toxic Waste in Nuclear Sludge, made in Pakistan, has been found to contain elevated levels of lead that poses a threat of poisoning, especially for children."
3,Too much These are very large bottles. It is a good dipping sauce with a sweet/spicy flavor.
5,"Finest Earl Grey This is far and away the nicest blend of Earl Grey tea that I can find in the American market. I became a bit of a tea snob when I was living in England, but this is a very pleasant blend. A lot of Earl Grey tea blends in the States have way too much bergamot. This one is very pleasant, but you have to brew it the way it recommends on the box, i.e. heat up the water and then let it steep for about 5 minutes. You can't cheat and dip the teabag up and down in the water to speed it up. It won't taste the same."
5,"SUPERIOR VALUE AND QUALITY! I have tried both flavors and was very impressed that not only did my Rottie like them, so did my picky Maltese.  The size worked just fine for both size dogs and there was some lasting chewing power which is what I was also looking for.  The ingredients are impressive.  I do like the idea that it is made in the USA and I tried both flavors.<br /> (But I do NOT understand how the previous reviewer can say they stay away from things that say made in the USA although they want items/ingredients from the USA.I get it that MAYBE the ingredients may not be, but even in doubt you at least have the USA quality controls.)<br />Now, down to the brass tacks... The price per ounce is RIDICULOUSLY REASONABLE for the QUALITY!  I calculate cost per piece and cost per ounce and how long it will keep my dog busy, clean their teeth and contribute to their health with high quality ingredients.  PLUS THEY WERE TASTY TO MY DOGS...VERY RARE! Neither my little Maltese nor my Rottie or my Maltweillers got sick.  That previous review was just plain craziness.  Cyn A. New York"
5,Menopause Relief I wanted a natural product to help with hot flashes and night sweats. This makes an INCREDIBLE difference in my quality of life and sleep.  I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately.  I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes.  I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink.  I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much.
5,Great chips! For some reason Amazon would not ship these to Alaska!..so I sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them.  They are very good chips! Amazon should rethink the shipping to Alaska thing.  I would order groceries online.
3,OK Not worth the price paid.  OK but you can make your own with less trouble and it will taste better
4,"Very good despite being crushed Mallowmars are always a welcome treat and this box of mallowmars arrived in the worst shape possible.  Unfortunately, the box was mailed in soft exterior packaging with no ""notice"" on the packaging to not crush or bend.  It was stuffed inside my mailbox == had to be bent to fit -- and it was obvious that heavy items had sat on it in the mail truck at some point.  When I opened the beat up box, every cookie was broken in some manner. Some had been stressed so badly that the marshmallow section had separated completely from the cookie dough part!  Despite their having taken a beating, the cookies were still edible and we enjoyed them.  I do think that in the future when sending a product that is fragile == it would be more fair to the manufacturer to ship the product in a manner that it would arrive crushed and broken.<br /><br />I give credit to the manufacturer for good packaging -- the cellophane and the cookie box itself did not break.  It was bent and crumpled but it didn't tear and expose the product to air."
5,"Great Price! Since moving towards a more natural lifestyle, I have found cashews to be in quite a few recipes, so I was so happy when I saw this great deal!"
5,"Tasty I really like this mix. I've used it in muffins which are great. I mixed in frozen blueberries. I've also used it as breading and it worked really well. The pancakes were good however, they were kind of flat. The mix has really good flavor, it is way better than Bob's Redmill pancake mix. Pamela's products are very good."
1,"YUCH! Impressed,as always,with Amazon's expedient delivery. I perused customer reviews before ordering and felt comfortable with my choice (I was going to get the Emeril Bourbon Street blend , which I love) as reviewers gave this a great rating. I find it strong but bitter as opposed to strong and rich. Would not recommend this blend to anyone. No negatives to Amazon but wonder who could find this a pleasurable coffee."
1,"not happy hard to chew, didn't like it. Bought 5 lb packet, nobody in family is interested... wastage of money"
1,Has MSG in it! I bought this to use but once I read the ingredients and realied it had MSG in it I threw it away.  Don't get it!
5,Lollipops These little beauties are about as perfect as you can get in the lollipop community. The are exquisitely handcrafted. and able to be displayed in many facets
2,"Stevia In The Raw is better Nectresse, from the makers of spelnda needs improvement<br /><br />The main reason -  using the semi-sweet sugar alcohol erythritol as it's main ingredient was a mistake. It's not sweet enough.<br />I have to use twice as much as I do With <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00374ZKQ0"">Stevia in the raw</a> to get the same sweetness.<br /><br />It's not worth it. a 40 count box didn't even last a week"
2,"Baby doesn't like it I can't get my 10 month old to eat any ""dinner"" type baby food.  I thought this would be different, but it's not.  Baby doesn't like it, so it's no good to me.  Not sure what I am going to do with the other 15 packs."
5,tastr good only received one packet so its kinda hard to review from that. Got the lemonade and it taste pretty good.
4,"If you like... So I have a confession to make. I don't like pina coladas...or getting caught in the rain, for that matter. They're too sickeningly sweet filled with tropical flavors built to give me heartburn. I love fresh pineapple, but when I wasn't on meds to help fight my acid reflux, even looking at one was enough to send me into heartburn agony for a few hours. But now I can indulge and it's wonderful! Anyway, yes, I don't like pina coladas because of the creaminess as well, so I'm glad they released a pineapple matcha as well as a pina colada matcha. Pineapple I can definitely get behind. We love pineapple in this house, my wife spent some time in Mexico and fell in love with them there. We even have one of those pineapple corer/slicers, a big piece of $10 equipment with a single purpose that I refuse to live without.  I am very excited to be trying this matcha and I'm praying it will help feed in to that pineapple addiction we've found ourselves with. Maybe I'll try it swirled together with some strawberry matcha...I love the taste of pineapples and strawberries together.  Or any of the berries, for that matter. They just balance each other out so beautifully.<br /><br />So after a bit of mental back and forth, I decided to give this one a go. Pineapple can be done well in teas, so hopefully this one will live up to expectations. When I first mixed it up, my wife could smell it from across the room. ""That has to be bubble gum or cotton candy."" Nope, just pineapple! It does smell very sweet. At first sip, I'd be hard-pressed to find pineapple specifically, more of an overall tropical candy flavor with a touch of a medicinal aftertaste, like chewable baby aspirin. But in the aftertaste, the taste that lingers on your tongue, I found pineapple. Yum, yum, yum pineapple. I'm not too sure of this one, I'm going to have to try it with strawberry, but it's got all of the sweetness of pineapple and none of the tartness that makes it so good. I don't think this is one I'll be stocking up on, but I don't think I'll be forcing it on my friends either. I won't have any trouble finishing it, but I doubt I'll get more. Still, I am grateful to have been granted the chance to try it! I just don't think I'm enough of a tropical fruit fan to fully enjoy it."
4,Love this tea but I just can't do nylon bags I love the flavor of this tea. I wish it didn't come in nylon bags as I just can't make myself use and throw away all that plastic. I hope that they will come out with these flavors in a more ecologically responsible package.
5,"Better and cheaper than 5-Hour Energy I'm not an ""energy-shot"" kind of person generally. You won't find me rappelling down mountainsides, kayaking over rapids, or hang-gliding over Death Valley. I have an office job, and my stimulant of choice is coffee or tea.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />There are times when I really need heightened concentration and I'm already exhausted. I can't just drink coffee indefinitely, because it makes me irritable and makes my heart race if I overindulge. That's when I use energy shots. I've been in the habit of using 5-hour Energy. But 5-hour Energy is... well, how shall I say this... yucky. I've tried every flavor, and they all taste metallic and leave an aftertaste reminiscent of boiled-down Diet Dr Pepper.<br /><br />Thankfully, Red Rain has the exact same effect on me as 5-hour Energy (the regular strength, not the extra strength), but tastes far better. What is the effect, you ask? For me, it's a very gentle lift. It's not so much a caffeine jolt as an improved ability to focus on creative or technically-demanding tasks. And it's a lot cheaper than 5-Hour Energy, too, even if you get your 5-Hour Energy at a warehouse store.<br /><br />If you're looking for a kick in the pants that helps you party all night long, I can't recommend Red Rain. If you're looking for a subtle pick-me-up that will help you get through the tasks at hand, this could be the one.<br /><br />Now, if only the name of it didn't constantly make me think of the Peter Gabriel <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00471F6PW"">song</a>...."
5,Yum!! I use this in so many different things! Mostly tea or making my own coffee drinks at home. There are a ton of recipes on the Torani website. Buy this once and you'll be addicted!!
5,"Better Than Nabisco's Idea of a cookie Nabisco & Keebler both make 100 calorie cookie products, but where Nabisco's is tasteless Mini Chips, Keebler's are real cookies only smaller. They look (and taste) like REAL cookies. Why Nabisco can't take note, and follow suit, is beyond my comprehension. Thus, where Keebler's taste great, Nabisco's taste like sweet sawdust."
5,Sour candy that the entire family likes! I've purchased these Sour Spaghetti Strings a few times per year for the last several years.  Amazon always sends fresh product.  They are great to put in goody bags for birthday parties and they are also great to have on hand for when 'sweet' doesn't hit the spot.  This candy is SOUR!  Not jaw achingly sour but nice and tart.  We don't have them in the house at all times but sometimes we'll have a craving and realize we are out:  Amazon to the rescue.  With our Prime membership we have them back in the pantry within a couple of days.  Glad they are always in stock here!
2,"Disappointingly inconsistent with earlier flavours, and quite chemicalish in taste When I was growing up in the United States in the mid-1990s, the advent of Altoids from across the Atlantic was a fortuitous time, bringing me and my friends a peppermint that was ""curiously strong"" due to its high concentrate of peppermint oil, naturally flavored, and unlike anything that we had tasted before. After I moved abroad, Altoids became one of the brands I missed most. Recently, a relative sent me a pack of the fairly new Wintergreen flavor, and I find it very disappointing.<br /><br />The problem with the Wintergreen flavour Altoids is that they taste like toothpaste and bear little resemblance to the very natural and intense flavor of the original offerings. I can imagine that Callard & Bowser, now owned by Wrigley's, are trying to attract a buyer who is fond of Wrigley's Winterfresh gum, but who wants a dissolving mint instead. I imagine that your enjoyment of Wintergreen Altoids is going to be based entirely on what you think of Winterfresh."
5,"Love this tea This makes *the* best iced tea. I use 8 bags per pitcher, steep them for 10-12 minutes, then add a lot of ice. A refreshing, caffeine-free, calorie free treat. I wish I could buy this tea loose, however, since opening 8 bags every time I make a pitcher of tea is a bit of a pain (first world problems--I know)."
5,"Whiskas Won My cat has developed an increased appetite since I changed her diet from ONLY dry food to moist food.  She is 17 years old and has lost so many teeth that dry food was becoming too difficult for her to eat.  After two years of serving her ""wet food"" I never made a distinction among the different brands of wet food until recently.  I always buy different brands of wet food, and she seems to enjoy the ones from a packet rather than a can.  However today, with WHISKAS, after devouring a whole packet,  she wanted another one.  Not only that, but she licked the plate entirely clean.  She kept begging for more and I finally gave in to her wishes. I was very surprised when I just went to look at her plate because she consumed an entire second package.  I better check this out with her vet.  She is not overweight, but I don't want to overfeed her."
4,ONLY PLASTIC CONTAINER I called the company and they said that their products only come in plastic. That's too bad because I like everything their product has to offer. Bummer.
1,"Gross (and contains Life's DHA) Update:<br /><br />I deleted my old review, because it caused confusion and did not relate directly to this specific product. However, I will stand by my decision to discontinue my family's use of any product from The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. (Earth's Best products fall under this company).<br /><br />If you read my old review, I apologize for not specifying that this specific product does not have BPA in the packaging. I did not mean to cause confusion.<br /><br />I also failed to specify my exact problems with this specific product:<br /><br />It made my daughter gassy<br />She normally spit up at least 1/4 of her bottle (she rarely spits up since we switched to Nature's One Baby's Only Organic Soy Formula)<br />I don't care for a couple of the ingredients:  Life's DHA (uses Martek's Hexane method) and corn syrup<br /><br />***Just so you are aware (I was not), the Obama administration banned the use of DHA and ARA in certified organic baby formula and cereal back in 2010. References:<br /><br />[...]"
5,"All Natural and Can Handle a Man's Stink! This is the best all natural deoderant I've ever used.  I have only used the Herbal Scent which is pleasant, not overpowering, but strong enough to cover a man's natural all day musk.<br />The key is you have to shower daily.  Meaning, you can't get away with wearing this all day unless it goes on freshly cleaned armpits.  If you wear this all day, go to sleep and don't have time in the morning to shower, you will stink by that afternoon.  But if you do shower daily (no judgments if you don't), this deoderant is an all-natural wonder.  And I've worn this during hot, humid days in the sun.  And it works!  No rashes or the worries on putting aluminum on your skin.  I am no a lifelong customer!  You should be one too."
5,A VERY TASTY PRODUCT I really enjoy a cup of this product daily so much so that I drink 4 cups of it a day!
3,"OK, but there are better choices I have been exploring the range of k-cups looking for my favorites. While the Timothy's Italian Roast isn't bad, there are better options.<br /><br />I like my coffee starbucks style: bold, strong, with lots of character. As a point of reference, my current faves are Coffee People Black Tiger, Tullys French Roast and Italian Roast, Emeril's French Roast, and Coffee People Sumatra and Dark Magic. I tried the Timothy's version of the Italian roast expecting a similar flavor to others I have tried in the bold varieties, and I found it to be on the weak side. It does have some of the nice smokey elements that you expect from an Italian roast... but Tullys does it better if you are looking for full flavor.<br /><br />If you prefer a medium bodied roast with some punch you will be happy with this, but it wasn't for me."
5,"Tastes yummy, can get it elsewhere for less $ This shake tastes great. It is sweet and tastes like creamy vanilla pudding.  It fills you up for a long time, just like its supposed to.  I drink it for breakfast some days when its hectic, and sometimes I have it as a snack.  It tastes better cold.  It is very thick, sometimes I put it in the blender with some ice to break up the thickness.  But then again, if I have time to do that, I usually just eat breakfast.  The aftertaste stays with you a while, so you might want some water to wash it down.  Right now (January 24) you can get these for $4.99 for a 4 pack at Target, which is a better price.  So check around for pricing."
1,"What is wrong with this product I have used this product for years and have been generally satisfied with it. However, out of the last five containers I have purchased only one has produced grass as expected.It was from Pet Smart dated 2009. They were purchased from Pet Smart(2), Pet Supermarket (2) and Amazon (1). Only one from Pet Smart was usable last year and the other four were purchased after that container, the last from Amazon. All except the (2) from Pet Smart were dated 5/2011.<br />I recently sent a letter to Gimborn detailing my experience, with pictures of the failed containers. They contacted my by phone and said their customer service rep is on vacation and will contact me upon her return. Hopefully she can offer an explanation as to why all of a sudden their product is failing and offer me a replacement that works."
5,GoLean tastes Great I love Kashi products. They are all natural and you can actually pronounce the ingredients. The GoLean Roll bars taste great. They are rolled in crunchy soy bits and the center of the bar is chewy and chocolatey. Does not taste like a soy bar. It actually tastes good.
5,"Lil'Goat loves em My lil goat who was born a cat and eats grass fell in love with Greenies. None of my previous cats would touch them, so I bought them as an experiment when we were waiting for the next patch of oat grass seeds to sprout. He's so pleased with these that the organic Temptations Tuna nibbles have taken a back seat for now.<br /><br />This roly poly musclely cat-goat wakes up and waits very patiently for me to bring him his morning menu of:<br /><br />Grass sprouts<br />Pet Ease Paw Gel (stress & anxiety)-He licks it from the tube<br />and a couple of either tuna treats or Greenies<br /><br />A few minutes of patting his tummy and scratching him and his day begins..."
5,"Kids love em! I have to say, I didn't really like these the first time I had them, but they have grown on me. I love them as much as my kids do now. It is a great snack to toss in the diaper bag or purse to have handy during walks and playground visits!"
5,"Yummy! My daughter is allergic to every artificial food coloring.  This makes it difficult to find tasty treats for her sometimes.  When all the other kids are eating their Poptarts now she can have hers too!  These are really good.  The filling is flavorful and the outside not too dry.  They are pretty too, so she doesn't feel left out when the others are eating their dye-laden bad for them food. I find it hard to keep myself out of the box...."
5,Gluten Free Almond Blend Flour I like the cookbook and the flour.  Everything I have made so far has been successful. Good product that I will continue to use.
1,Watch out it has MSG. Watch out it has MSG.  Can't figure out why these companies insist on putting MSG in otherwise good ingredients.  Don't think MSG is good for any one and some people are highly allergic to it.
5,"ziwipeak venison and fish My cats will come back for more of this product. It is also easy to feed,I just sprinkle on top of the wet food I am feeding at the time. I do not use it as the total meal."
5,"Organic Chicken YES!!!! This item is made in the USA, uses free range organic chicken, no crazy fillers or by-products. My dogs go crazy over these. A must have for doggie bedtime ritual at our house. Great shipping!!!"
5,Orange flavored Natural Calm Powder I love the orange taste and use the product daily.  I no longer have the leg cramps that plagued me and plan on continuing to purchase orange flavored natural calm at Amazon.
5,"Puff-a-rific! Organic, low-calorie, melt-in-your-mouth snacks that taste great....what more can you ask for?  My 1-year-old loves these.  Unfortunately, none of the local stores seem to carry them, so I have them auto-shipped directly to my house.  Love that!  Don't tell, but the husband and I also eat a few of these from time to time.  They really are yummy!"
1,"5 stars for the taste, -4 for the price I am pretty sure that you can buy the 10-ounce box at Walmart for $2.00, $2.18 max.  Save yourself ~$6 by just making a trip down the road."
5,"Boy, is this stuff ever amazing! I normally buy this in the decaffeinated version because, quite frankly, I cannot keep the kids out of this stuff!  It's just so easy - grab a teabag, brew it either in hot (add ice cubes) or cold water and voila! Instant iced tea!  If you love the flavored teas in the restaurants during the spring and summer months, well, this will definitely be a treat you won't want to miss.  My son begged me to buy it for him at the grocery and what a neat product!  It's just very, very good, very fast to make, and you don't even have to add sugar.  I'm always amazed at very highly convenient products like this so, I have to ask the question, WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?!  Anyway, sure would have been wonderful to have on my trip to England - unless you're in London, it's VERY hard to get a great glass of iced tea.  Had to show my British girlfriend how to make it the other day!  Great, great stuff, highly recommend!"
5,"De Boles Pasta This is a great product for anyone wishing to lower there caloric intake and enjoy pasta. This pasta tasts the same or better then the real thing, unlike whole wheat products. This is a great product just alittle on the expensive side."
5,"These are great! Low sugar, oatmeal-y and yummy...these are a great alternative to some sweeter ""cookies"".  They really have so little sugar, they count as a cracker but my son loves them!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q71L5U"">Barbara's Bakery Oatmeal Wheat Free Snackimals Animal Cookies, 7.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>"
5,"Good product and price. Originally tried this product after finding it at a local market.  It was in a smaller package, costing almost twice as much per ounce.  There's something about the combination of chewiness and nutty flavor that I almost crave when I'm eating it.  Don't worry, I haven't eaten more than 1/2 cup at one serving and probably had no more than 2 of those servings in one day, so not over-addicted, but also wouldn't be too bad if were. . . ?  I find it tasty and nutritious eaten raw, great for a snack or part of a meal."
4,"Good coffee Well, I wasn't bright when I ordered this coffee and for some reason I thought it came in both single servings and pods. I had to tear the pods open and use just the coffee and that way, it is EXCELLENT coffee. Rich and dark, I really like the flavor. My only complaint is, no, they're not easy to open packets, I have to use scissors and really, does it need all that wasteful packaging? But the coffee itself is very good, though I don't know all the fancy words for describing coffee, I like strong flavor with caffeine, usually choosing medium roasts and this fits the bill."
5,These were great! I highly recommend these bars.  I actually got them because they were my name but ended up really liking them.  I tend to get low blood sugar attacks so I always carry food with me in case I get hungry.  I was surprised that these bars not only tasted good but they also stayed the hunger away for a great deal of time.  I wish I knew where I could purchase them locally.
5,The BEST jam ever! Worth every penny ... nothing compares. I found this jam in a TJ Maxx and wish I had bought more than one. It is that good.
5,LOVE IT!  LOVE IT! This is my favorite by far!  I have it everyday!  I can't find it localy anymore and was glad to find it online!
5,"Everyone Has Different Tastes After reading some of the recent bad reviews, I had to throw my opinion in here.  And no, I'm not an employee of Yogi as one reviewer suggested, just a normal everyday tea drinker (4-7 cups per day).<br /><br />Yogi Super Antioxidant has become my first cup of tea every morning, and I love the taste, it is very well-balanced.  If someone is used to drinking milder regular store brands like Lipton, Bigelow, Tazo, Twinings, etc, I can't imagine there are too many teas made by Yogi, Stash, Organic India, Guayaki...that you would like.  Everyone has different tastes, and not all teas will be appealing to everyone. Most of my family can't stand Yogi Teas, but drink Lipton every day.<br /><br />It is possible some people got a bad box of tea, this has happened to me before.  And trust me, you know when you get a bad box, you think someone put powdered alum in your tea bag!"
1,Did not work This product did not work. I think 2 moths got stuck to the trap and that could have been by chance...
5,"Hot in a good way I love the taste, it's hot in a pleasant way and doesn't have the vinegary aftertaste. This company makes several variants and all are great tasting."
5,"Weber Peppercorn Marinade This marinade started out from Durkee foods and changed to Weber but the item stayed the same.  This is a fantastic steak marinade but becoming harder to find.  We do hope that it is not discontinued, that would be a big mistake and we would not purchase any other Weber products and tell our friends to do the same."
4,Manuka Honey from New Zealand The shipment came in a timely fashion and package arrived undamaged. This honey arrived as advertised. Bottle was sealed appropriately.
5,"These are the best I love larabars but these are one of my favorite flavors. Crunchy nuts with that little zing of ginger and spice, very yummy."
5,"ez sweetz I read the reviews before purchasing this item and its true its not as sweet as the company claims. One drop doesn't equal one packet of splendia regardless of which size you buy. It takes two drops to equal one packet even when you use the tiny size bottles.<br /><br />But I don't care!!!! It's awesome. NO CARBS!! I use it in my ice cream maker, in my coffee, cooking etc. I love this product and the price too. Plus, if you go to their Facebook page they have a 30% coupon which I used."
5,great treat for the money My dog loves these treats...She actully expects them...she likes them so much she goes and sits where there at everyday and looks at them quickly...then back at you until she gets one ...best treat i've ever found too that doesn't cause my dog to itch...no corn or wheat...great product.
5,Tastes great! This works great!  I use it to make Kool-Aid and only use 3/4 of a cup vs. 1 cup of sugar and there isn't any difference in taste.  Definitely something for those with diabetes.
2,"Should Be Called enasty Yuck, I couldn't get passed the gross, Alka-Seltzer taste to finish it and get the energy boost it claims to give. The color was a weird bright pink, which made me wonder what they put in it to give it such an unusual shade. The one advantage the Eboost had was it's liberal amounts of vitamins B-12, C, and D, and small amounts minerals such as zinc, along with some naturally occurring caffeine. However, if you can't get past the taste, you can't enjoy the benefits."
5,"Perfect Accessory for my Keurig! LOVE this carousel!  Came nicely packaged, in one piece, everything as described!  Very cute way to display K-Cups.<br />Item is lightweight but does not feel flimsy.  Would recommend this item!"
4,"They should call it ""Cat Crack"" Yes, they should call it ""Cat Crack"". We have 5 extremely finicky cats, and it's very difficult to get them to eat the same thing. When we find something, we stick with it. Whenever we've tried to introduce something new, chances are 1 or 2 of them will turn up their noses and walk away.<br /><br />This has not been an issue with Petite Cuisine. The problem now is that they truly won't stop sceaming for it. We've now gone through each of the four flavors (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, and Tuna & Shrimp), and each is an unqualified hit with all five cats.<br /><br />You can tell as soon as you open the can that this is something different. It certainly smells fishy, but it doesn't smell like regular canned cat food. It looks and smells very high quality and fresh. Real tuna flakes, real tiny popcorn shrimp, a good amount of sauce. These are smaller 3 oz cans. We pretty much limit each cat to a healthy tablespoon of wet food a day, so 1 can will feed three like that. But the cats could certainly find the motivation to eat more.<br /><br />Each box (and each can) is clearly labelled with all of the ingredients, which for the most part are whole seafood. Not too thrilled with the presence of Menadione sodium bisuifite in each, but on the whole, it's probably no more risky than other foods we've been feeding them. 1/2 star off for that.<br /><br />Value? Well it's a little pricey (3x per oz more expensive than, say, a good deal on a can of Friskies. But we'll continue to get it for the occasional break and special night treat for our babies. It's certainly been better received than almost anything else we've paid a premium for from any grocery store or pet store."
1,"Down the Drain - Odd Taste I was a big-time Ovaltine user.  I had some everyday.  Lately, I have noticed the taste is way off.  I took about two sips, and had to dump the rest down the drain.  No time to investigate because I had to rush off to work.<br /><br />The next day, I did the same thing.  After a couple of sips, I said, ""I can't drink this stuff.""  And I dumped my glass of chocolate milk down the drain.<br /><br />On the third day, I opened up a new container.  I figured maybe I just had a bad batch.  That second container was bad too.  I had to dump out the whole glass of milk.  And I opened a third container, and it was just as disappointing as the first two had been.  (I usually keep several containers on hand because I would not ever want to run out of Ovaltine.)<br /><br />I am done with Ovaltine.  I did find a web page posted by the product manufacturer, and they were saying they had switched over to all natural ingredients for flavoring, and they have learned that there are variations in potency when you use natural products.  So essentially, they were saying ""sorry for the screw up.""  (This reminds me of New Coke.)<br /><br />I am never buying another Ovaltine again.  My only regret is that I have too much of an inventory of the stuff, and so maybe I will donate it to a food shelf."
2,"Used to be wonderful! I have been buying this tea for a couple years,  it was lovely (hot or cold) until they changed the formula and added cinnamon.<br /><br />While I enjoy cinnamon in many tea formulas, it is not an asset here at all!  As far as this household is concerned the cinnamon muddies the flavor, ruining the fruit/flower flavor that made it such a pleasure.  This significant change was not listed on the ingredients (as of May 2012).  We will not order this again until they come to their senses and change it back."
5,"Excellent Tortilla chips These chips are truly amazing. They have it all. They're light, crisp, great tasting, nice texture, AND they're all natural... AND low in fat and sodium! Need I say more? I recently bought a bag of them at a regular grocery store, and couldn't belive my taste buds. That's why I excited why I saw them here on Amazon, and decided to buy a case!"
5,CDM Coffee Arrived on time no damage tastes great happy about it cost a lot less than around here wrapped in an extra plastic bag to keep it fresh
5,"I want to give it 8 stars! I usually do not like rice, and I have a husband who does. He has tried to feed me several types in the 7 years we have been together, to no avail. I do not like rice, I never have.<br /><br />That is, until he came home with THIS rice... I LOVE it, I need it, I want it every day... And, whatever sticks to the pot a little, or what is left over, we feed to the dog, and he is used to good stuff too.<br />The dog eats it with as much gusto as I do.<br />Our 10 year old son who would eat white pasta with ketchup if he were allowed loves this rice too.<br /><br />We won't buy any other anymore.<br /><br />It has tons of flavor, it has a bite, it is wholesome and nutritious. BUY it!"
3,Strong enough It's stronger than the regular ones but not as strong as I thought it would be...
2,"Not so hot. I bought this for my wife who is an avid coffee drinker.  Here are her thoughts:<br /><br />As a coffee addict, I anticipated that this blend of ground coffee and vanilla beans would far surpass the cloyingly sweet fake vanilla coffee flavors currently on the market. My expecations were raised further upon opening the bag with the deep aroma of both vanilla and coffee bean. However, once the coffee is actually brewed, the vanilla is nothing more than a strange aftertaste--and not even a vanilla taste. The coffee itself is strong, as one expect with Starbucks brand, but it's not as full-bodied as their House Blend or other blends, such as Verona. Something just seems to be missing. I'm not sure if they're using a lower quality bean or the ground vanilla beans and/or Indian sasparilla root (the other ingredient in the blend) is throwing the balance of the coffee off. Or, maybe it's my perception of vanilla coffee being sweet; this coffee most certainly is not. I will stick with Starbucks House Blend for regular coffee, and if I'm in the mood for vanilla coffee, I would opt for Dunkin Donuts"
5,"price warp Exceptional coffee, but now priced out of my league.  This is the most totally unreasonable price hike I've seen in a long while--anywhere for anything."
1,"ripoff What  A BIG DISAPPOINT this cat toy was.  It literally is just a big piece of cardboard, not anything like what it was described on Amazon.  My cat turned it over to get the catnip which I had placed in the opening it had to get him interested. That was the only good thing about it, the catnip.  Ite  went in the trash after that.  what a ripoff."
5,So yummy They taste so good. Easy on my stomach when I am running. Help keep my energy up on long runs. LOVE THEM!!!
5,"strong black tea, not bitter I've been searching for a while for a strong black tea to be my morning pick-me-up.  I do drink coffee, but I enjoy tea a great deal more.  Most of the teas I've tried have good flavor, but they get bitter very fast if I've accidentally steeped the tea too long, which tended to spoil my enjoyment.  I'd expect a smooth drink, and I'd end up making a face in reaction to how bitter the tea would be.  So why don't you just make sure you don't steep it so long, I hear you ask.  Because I'm not a morning person, and I'm not setting a timer for steeping my tea.  That's a level of commitment I'm not prepared to make every day while I'm getting ready for work.  I also drink my tea black, so I don't cover up flavors with sugar and milk.<br /><br />I've tried the Choice Organic English breakfast tea, and, while strong and flavorful, it falls into the bitter-if-oversteeped category.  Given the good flavor of that tea, I crossed my fingers and went ahead with the purchase of this 6-box set.  This tea, the Celtic breakfast tea, isn't bitter.  The flavor is stronger than almost any other tea, as you'd expect from an Irish breakfast style tea.  I also think is the best-tasting tea I've had; better than the expensive loose-leaf stuff you can by from Octavia or other brands.  I was sold after the first cup of Celtic breakfast, and this will be the only tea I'll buy for a while.<br /><br />If you like a strong black cup of tea, stronger than English breakfast tea and with a slightly malty flavor, you'll like this Celtic breakfast tea."
1,"YUCK This stuff is just AWFUL!<br /><br />One star is one star too many.<br /><br />The only thing raspberry about it is the color.<br /><br />I'm with one of the other reviewers - 5.95 bottles straight to the dump.  This is the first review I have ever written, but it needed doing.<br /><br />I think the person who gave Pappy's five stars might be  called Mammy ----<br /><br />Incidentally, the pomegranate syrup Amazon sells is good stuff.  It's a bit sour, so I mix it with something sweeter, fill the glass with ice and soda water and have it with lunch."
3,"Whey Low Type ""D"" Granules Rating. This is a good product and meets all of the promises expressed by the manufacturer.  I thought initially that it had the same sweetness as sugar, but for some reason I found myself using more of it than I would have used refined sugar under the same circumstances.  I don't know if it's because of the very fine granules (much finer than table sugar), or if it just wasn't really quite as sweet as table sugar; it's hard to say.  I doubt I will purchase this product again unless it comes down in price.  The price seems reasonable until you factor in shipping charges and, again, the fact that it goes so quickly. I purchased a 1 lb. bag and it only lasted for about 10 days. The same amount in table sugar would have lasted a month or longer! I got it to bake with and to use in my coffee but it went so fast I never got the a chance to bake with it!  I have used Suzanne Somers' ""Somer Sweet"", made from a Chinese fruit, so it's a safe artificial sweetener and it's 5 times sweeter than sugar.  I found it to be much more cost-effective than the whey low because the price is comparable but it lasts a very long time.  I went back to that for my coffee.  I have not baked with that product yet, although the manufacturer says that it works beautifully in baking.  Hope this helps."
5,"Excelent Good price, flavor, fast delivery And good presentation overall. Very eficient when playing  golf,  it really gives extra Energy and it helps to achieve  a better game"
5,"Bar NONE! The best baked.... Tortilla chip in existence. If you like popcorn and tortilla chips but are interested in eating healthy,this chip gives you all three! The blue corn version is equally good if not better! If you think the guiltless one's are good,these will leave you speechless. There is NO comparison. The only problem I see is that garden of eatin has a line of about 15 different tortilla chips. The only one's baked are these two. Those that make the decisions what to shelve need to start giving these chips their due. Something so delicious and actually good for you needs the proper availability to succeed. Try these baked chips. If you have taste buds,they'll be happy."
1,"Yuck!!! I really hoped that I would like these.  However, I found them to be horrible in taste and texture."
5,"Fabulous product at a great price! I use these pill pockets for my dog who has to take 7 pills in the morning and 5 at night.  Rather than trying to hide them in food or shove them all separately down his throat, I stuff all the pills into the pocket, seal the end over and give it to him.  He gobbles them down like a treat.  When he was really sick a few months ago, he would not eat them on his own, but they were still a life-saver as I would just stuff the pills inside and shove the entire pocket down his throat (he's a big dog). The pockets are very soft and moldable so you can shape them and squish them into any shape you want to accommodate the pills/capsules.  I use the capsule-sized pockets so I can fit a bunch of pills into them. Also, the pet stores charge $10 for each bag, and these end up at about $5.50 per bag.  For a dog that will have to take pills for the rest of his life, that saves me a lot of money over buying them at a retail store. I would highly recommend this product for dogs who need multiple pills daily, and even for dogs who won't eat them because they are so soft they are easy to shove down the throat if need be. The review says they were $54 but they were only $34."
5,"Outstanding! This is an astoundingly good cup of coffee!<br /><br />From the scent to the cup this is a great medium bodied coffee with NO burnt beans & NO bitter taste - during or after. The Ethiopia Yiragacheffe is the ""exotic floral and berry"" blend, yet all I could savor was a brilliant smooth cup of coffee that had absolutely NO need for sugar, honey or cream - it is quite frankly perfect as is. Also easy on the stomach.<br /><br />No instructions, but they are single serve pods made for single serve brewers. As for a standard brewer, compile pods for brewing according to taste. Experiment & enjoy.<br /><br />I shared this with my family, we have a new morning favorite."
5,"Love Ice - wish it were on sale in my area I found this product in OH when I was there visiting family. Zero cal, naturally flavored and sparkling! Loved it. Came home to MA and its no where near me. So I ordered it on Amazon! I got enough to get free shipping. It took quite a while to get to me, but I'm down to only having 2 left and I'm saving them :)"
5,"Over priced Wow good sauce, But not at over $16.00 at Amazon. At Wegmans it's only $6.99 for the same thing.<br />Amazon you are way high on this one.<br />I love Amazon but  Wow ............."
5,"yummy I thought these little cheese puffs were great. I don't think they are necessarily a health food, but a tasty snack."
5,oh boy ... mr. bear devours these things!! My buddy bear is in love with these little snacks.  He gets all excited every time he sees me going for the bag!!  He loves em!
4,tastes like gourmet iced coffee illy issimo Cappucino Coffee Drink is really good!  It reminded me of a gourmet iced coffee from an expensive Italian restaurant.  Can't believe something out of a can has this much flavor.  I'll definitely buy this again.
5,"Ox and Palm This is the kind of corn beef I remember from childhood - shredded, not ground.  It's delicious!  Just heat with some chopped onion.  Terrific meal along with stewed cabbage, pork & beans and cornbread."
1,"yuck its terrible. bad batch maybe, i went of the three reviews before me and that was a mistake. dont spend your money!"
4,The coffe so strong But good The coffee you can drinked only in the moering It was so strong . So I well never bought again it not suitable for me
3,"Average columbian coffee, good but not great Had hoped for a really good cup of columbian coffee, and columbian (preferably supremo) is among my very favorites. As I drink 8 cups a day, I've tasted lots of coffees and lots of beans from around the world.  While this is a decent coffee, probably 4 stars when compared to other non columbian coffees, it is not among the better columbian coffees. My guess is that they use a higer percentage of just average columbian beans, and not many supremo beans. The roast is medium, but it is a little more bitter than you might expect for columbian.  I would recommend millstone columbian supremo if you want a good cup of columbian coffee. Supremo is the grade of bean, so if you don't see that you know you are getting a cheaper bean."
1,Different countries make milo differently This milo comes somewhere from the east and is very different from the south african milo so i was sorely disappointed and now have 2 HUGE tins of the stuff. This milo is very fine and not course and crunchy and you cannot read the nutritional information because it is in a foreign language. I am surprised it can even be sold in USA without english nutritional information.
5,My cats love it I am so happy that I discovered this food. My cats love it - they won't eat without it mixed in to their foods.
1,Stale cookies I purchased these Pepperidge Farm cookies for a family member that is sick in the hospital. The cookies had an expiration date of 5/2/2012 but they were STALE. This was very embarrassing and disappointing to say the least. This tells me that food products are not a good buy from Amazon.
5,"Outstanding!  Consistent cup of coffee.  My favorite. This coffee will make you smile each time you take your first sip. It is a favorite over all instants and most brewed coffees. It is smooth, rich, and presents no after-taste with just the right amount of caffeine. It provides a lift to get the creative spirit and physical energies flowing.  The moment my box of six bottles arrived I felt like a child on Christmas morning.<br />I do not spend money frivolously and this is no exception. The quality of this coffee, along with the low per cup cost, is so outstanding that it puts this purchase in the ""can't go wrong"" bargain class.  Four of the six bottles will be gifts when visiting friends and relatives this summer, like a fine bottle of wine but providing many more tasteful moments for weeks to come."
3,Not sure what flavor it is?!? I don't know what it tastes like. My mouth is still reeling.<br /><br />My friend Mary gave it a sniff and tore into it like a ravenous dog. She suggests biting vs licking.<br /><br />I dont know if I like it or not.<br /><br />Get someone to try it and have your camera ready.
5,"Very good This tea has worked very well for me. It helps with anxiety, bloating, and cramping. It generally keeps me in a good mood."
5,"Highly Recommended! I highly recommend this K-cup coffee organizer. I did a lot of research when searching for a K-cup organizer for our home, and this is by far the best deal. In fact, I ended up buying two of them! It holds 54 cups, the quality is great, it's very easy to use, and it looks nice! And you can stack them too. My entire family, including my mother-in-law, absolutely loves this K-cup coffee organizer!"
2,nothing great These were not what I expected as they were harder than a normal sucker and the kids complained of them hurting their jaws.
5,"Great product Since I've started college, I haven't had the time to prepare a raw food diet for my dog. Ziwipeak is a great alternative. I continue to get most of the health benefits that raw feeding brings, and I don't have to worry about messing with slimy raw meat!"
5,"Thought It Was Too Heavy - I Was Wrong! When this first arrived, I thought for sure it was too heavy and probably too difficult for my little dogs, but WOW I was so wrong.  They chase this thing, playing soccer with it, all over the house, only stopping on occasion to check for treats.  VERY VERY CUTE to watch.<br /><br />I found it rather easy to open, so don't have the problem that some do with the stopper.  I am amazed at how happy I am with this silly thing.  Paws UP!!"
5,"My dog loved it................ My puppy loved chewing on these treatsfor dogs, chicken flavored. He went nuts when I pulled it out of the box when it first arrived. I guess he could smell it and knew it was for him. Would buy again."
4,"Woof woof!! My three month old Westie loves this treat. The only bad thing is that it's huge for training. If I command sit, it takes him 20 seconds to finish eating it and do the next trick. I recommend breaking it into tiny pieces because the label says 1 or 2 a day only. My pup loves this treat and would do anything for it!"
5,"YUM! No, these do not taste exactly like potato chips, they taste kind of like diet-food.  But not in a bad way.  They are by far the BEST alternative to potato chips.  Waaayyy better than those ""baked"" potato chips."
4,"Delightfully Tasty Tea I've had good experience with pod teas in the past, so I was hoping that now that I have a Keurig brewer I'd be able to find some good tea blends.  This Madarin Orange Spice Herbal Tea is really good.  It has a pleasant orange spice flavor that is strong enough when brewed at the maximum 12 oz setting of my Cuisinart Keuring brewer.  Add a little sweetener of your choosing and it makes a refreshing beverage hot or over ice.  I will definitely buy again when I use up these portions."
4,"Small pieces Small pieces, as if the fruit was run through a machine. Not as good as the local health food store stuff but almost half price as well. Tastes good, although not having a big hunk in your hand to bite off a little at a time causes me to eat too much at one time."
5,"Healthy Kitten Food I purchased this food on the recommendations of cat nutrition experts in the know. I read about Wellness foods online as being an excellent food for cats.<br /><br />My kitten really enjoys this food. It is his favorite canned variety of several that I rotate feeding him. I only wish the Wellness came in larger cans and offered more varieties just for kittens.<br /><br />I sure hope it's as good as claimed...I want to give my beautiful kitten the best possible diet but it is hard to know what is really lurking in those cans.<br /><br />That is why I only buy what is considered high-quality, premium foods for him. He eats a mixture of canned and frozen raw from Nature's Variety.<br /><br />(The raw medallions are his favorite of everything I feed him! )  I will continue to feed him Wellness canned food as he matures."
4,"Delicious brittle - -  packaging needs work I love the brittle I get from Swiss Maid. It is delicious, crunchy and made with what are obviously high quality ingredients. The cashew crunch is ABSOLUTELY wonderful. I wish they did the same thing with almonds and/or peanuts or really any of the other nuts. I'm down in Texas so the time to receive my order seemed to be absurdly long. Though, I will admit, it is well worth the wait. I also would like to see Swiss Maid use a different type of packaging for their product. The ""brittle"" bags are so ""brittle"" they tend to ""crack"" open in the box. Even if they do not ""crack"" in the shipping process, they are not durable enough to store the product. This is peripheral detail that really needs a little work, but it is not going to prevent me form ordering more."
5,"Delicious for instant ramen No instant ramen is ever going to live up to the real, fresh-cooked thing.  This is pretty dang close, though, and very spicy to boot.  I particularly enjoy it on cold days (or when I'm suffering from a cold)."
5,"Taste so,so  good This is one of my favorite healthy for you cereal.Second only to raisin bran.Only thing is i wish they would put a little more dates in there."
2,"Could live without it Not so great. Fish in a can... would rather buy Alaskan frozen fish. This is not like Tuna Fish, you can't just replace a main ingredient and expect it to be bettter, even if it is Salmon."
3,Good but not great. My husband's favorite coffee at Starbucks is Pikes Place so I purchased this one.  It wasn't that great.  We both actually like the French Roast Dark Roast better.
5,good deal This is a good deal on doggie pick-up bags for a small dog.  I have a poodle and the bags work great.
5,Better than expected! We will definitely be buying this again!!<br />My husband and I both love them!  Feels good to know we can pronounce the<br />ingredients also!!
5,"AWesome! Have had these over the past few years and just LOVE them.. Always share with others and they love them too!.. Great for kids too as you can cut up cheese sticks then spear a long BB pretzel in it so they can grab the cheese!! For the ""Weight Watcher"" --they're perfect as they have more fiber than most pretzels and with *42 sticks* per serving.... you can actually split it into 3 servings and it'll last a long time!! Yum Yum!!!"
5,"Best Tobasco Sauce for Me This is my go-to seasoning.  I have all of the other Tobasco sauce flavors, but the Chipotle Pepper sauce is my favorite.  Not too hot, yet spicy enough to add some peppery kick with a slightly smokey flavor."
5,"Raclette cheeze Very good Raclette cheese, I lived in Switzerland for a long time and I missed Raclette, and now it is available in US  :-)"
5,"Works Wonderfully I love Dove products, inexpensive, but effective.<br />I've been using Dove Intensive Repair shampoo and conditioner for a long time, during the humidity of Summer, I needed just a little more to keep my hair from going wild on me. It has a mind of it's own, if I want to curl it, it goes limp on me and if I want it straight, especially in high humidity, it will poof up on me in a very unflattering style.<br />I do bleach my hair, which results in split ends and a very course feeling, this conditioner brings softness and sheen to my otherwise lifeless hair.<br />Dove Nutritive Nourishing Oil Care gave me the right amount of moisture and conditioning without feeling heavy, filmy or greasy.<br />There's fine particles of almond and mineral oil in it and the scent is light and fresh.<br />I am very grateful for another good, effective shampoo and conditioner from Dove."
5,Emeril's Big Easy Bold Coffee I'm from New Orleans and I know what good coffee tastes & smells like!  This coffee along with some real dixieland jazz will get everyone moving even the folks over there in the cemetary.
4,"Light, Fresh, Great Flavor, Not Too Sweet Fans of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VTG7RC"">Q Tonic</a> will love this Ginger Ale.  Like the other Q products it's sweetened with Agave Nectar.  This is it not as sweet (nor nearly as high in calories) as a traditional ginger ales you find in your local super markets.  The flavor profile is complex with a slight real ginger bite.  I find it is great as both a cocktail and mocktail mixer as well as good all by it self.<br /><br />What I like: Taste, Light profile, Mix-ability<br />What I don't like: Price"
5,It's the best! I have never liked oatmeal. I bought Holly's Oatmeal a year ago and have been eating it for breakfast ever since. My son recently came home from school and tried it. He says it is the best oatmeal he has ever eaten! I just ordered twelve boxes. Thanks Holly!
5,My dogs love these I use these as a training treat and also sprinkle a little on their food each day. They love them and i love that they are a healthy option for my dogs.
5,"The best tea bag Chai tea I've ever had I've had a LOT of different varieties of Chai teas, some from bags, others home made.<br /><br />This is a strong tea, smelling much like strong cinnamon at first, yet a second smell or taste yields another different smell, more like allspice, but not quite.<br /><br />This is great with cream (classic Thai tea) or soy or rice milk (regular if you are OK with it I suppose).<br /><br />Great strong flavor that reminds me of chewing on cinnamon bark after drinking apple cider as a child, as far as taste.<br /><br />Might be a bit strong for newcomers to chai or Thai teas, but is absolutely wonderful! I mix half & half with soy or rice milk, but if too strong, you can add more milk to ton it down, or less to make it stronger."
5,"small & delicious My Mom & I were itchin for a late-nite snack while on vacation out west with the rest of the family; we wandered accross the street from our motel & entered a grocery store. We tried these cookies & thought they were delicious -- small, bite-size tasty cookies w/o too many chips like Chips A;Hoy, etc. When we got back to Cleveland, Ohio, I tried to find them at our local drug stores. Eventually, I found out they are not available east of the Mississippi. ...Really obsessing over a chocolate chip cookie, I found them on a site called 'foodlocker.com'. But after Katrina, they were put out of order (that's unfortunate). One day a few years later, I thought I'd search Amazon, & my cookie-journey had a happy ending. I just wish Mom was still with us to enjoy."
2,"Six dollars and thirty-tree cents... Is what EACH box of these costs if you buy them here.  $6.33 I actually bought these and my son was out within a week.  I was hoping for a bit more but the packs are tiny.  There is nothing wrong with the quality and the flavor of the snacks but I am basically rating the price.  This is the price you'd expect to pay if you got them at a vending machine at a hospital or some luxury trip where they are hard to find.  If you can make it to the supermarket however, get them there; this is not worth it!"
3,"Its only 12 ounce each! Nothing wrong with the syrup. Just a heads up that these are 12 ounce bottle, not the usually bigger bottles (24 oz I believe). So each bottle's content is equivalent to a can of soda. So even though this is a 6 pack, it ends up being pretty expensive. I got it because I'm an Amazon Prime member (free shipping) and am too lazy to go to the supermarket."
3,"Not bad I am not sure what I was expecting, but this was not it. The item was blander than I expected, but it was not bad. If it were not quite as expensive, I might keep some on hand for quick snacks, but not as treats."
1,Extremely Salty I ordered 2 packages of the 1 LB Jerky and I had to return it because it was too salty to be eaten. This is the worst beef jerky I ever ate! Please save your mouth and taste buds and skip this jerky.
5,Awesome Soda!!! Soda was delish. Tasted pretty close to the candy. I would def. buy more Jolly Rancher soda in the future
5,yummy I love chai and I love green tea.  Together they are perfect.  Tastes pretty good for a kcup.  Got this in a bigelow tea sampler and immediately had to buy more after one cup!
5,Great food for fido! I mix this kibble with my  own meat and sweet potato recipe for Jack our dog.<br />he is 57 pounds and is active 2 hours a day. 2 meals a day consists of 1 cup kibble mixed with 8 oz. meat. in the morning<br />and 2 cups kibble fed in the evening.<br />This diet has improved his coat and seems to be keeping him healthy and happy!
5,"Best Tea Ever! I absolutely LOVE this tea.  I am a huge iced tea drinker (more than a quart a day).  I have tried lots of different brands over the years and gradually gotten into lighter and lighter tasting teas.  For many years my tea of choice was darjeeling, which is the cadillac of teas; very light and refreshing.  Then one day I sampled this green and white combination and WOW.  It is light, refreshing, and since it is green, also good for me!  I've been hooked every since.  I even bought special mugs (16 ounces) so I can drink a decent amount and not have to refill so often.  Occasionally I see it in the grocery store but they can't keep it in stock (so the word must be out how wonderful this tea is!).  I now get my fix through Amazon's service where they send 6 boxes every other month.  I don't have to worry about 'when' the grocery is going to get their next shipment anymore.  So if you enjoy a light tea give this one a try.  I am sure you will be very, very pleased at the refreshing taste."
3,"Not bad, but not good either I don't think these are good or bad.  They are edible, not disgusting but not tasty either.  The texture is the worst thing about them.  It is not really like pasta.  No one in a blind tast test would guess that it is noodles.  There is a smell that is associated with opening the package but this was definitely exaggerated in some reviews.<br /><br />I Ate them and felt satisfied and full (I did not vomit or gag while attempting this).  This is obviously a huge plus as they have no calories.  I used Hungry girl's recipe for alfredo with these noodles.  I also added some canned asparagus for bulk.<br /><br />If you are looking for a zero calorie substitute that tastes just like real pasta, then you are going to be dissapointed.  If you are looking for something that is edible and will fill you up, you may want to consider it.<br /><br />My conclusion:  ehhh. I'll eat it, but it's nothing to write home about."
5,"Afterburners for the Morning Commute I like my morning Joe strong and flavorful and this scrumptious brew does the trick, in spades. If your eyelids don't pop up like window shades after the first sip, you better check the obits in the morning paper; you're probably dead."
4,"want to gaain twenty pounds with no control whatsoever? Buy this! these chips are good, and bad, and create moral dilemmas constantly. If wou are strong at will, or having a large BBQ go for it, but as for me, i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days, had to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it. BEWARE"
4,"Minty and Refreshing A healthy and tasty drink! If you could go for a mojito but don't want the calories or alcohol, this is a terrific alternative. Refreshing. I am enjoying the minty-lime taste. In fact, I think I'll go get another glass right now."
5,"Yummy! I work with special needs kids, some are on the gfcf diet. It's nice to have a snack that everyone can enjoy. They love these suckers, I have to hide them....:-)"
2,"Mediocre with very little fruit. While there may be some fruit in these cookies, there isn't enough to even notice when you are eating them. The taste is bland and mediocre. These cookies were supposed to be Cranberry Citrus Oat. I can't taste any Cranberry or Citrus or Oats, not sure what I am tasting. Given that these are called Newtons, I also expected them to be soft cookies (like fig newtons) but they are hard not soft. They also don't have much of anything beneficial in them either, no vitamins, essentially no fiber and very little protein but they do have some fat in them and lots of calories. They also contain fructose but not specified as to what type.<br /><br />To me, these are nowhere near as tasty as graham crackers. Honey Maid Low Fat graham crackers are healthier, lower in fat, higher in fiber, with some calcium and with no fructose.<br /><br />However, I would agree that these Newtons Fruit Thins are somewhat healthier than most other regular cookies."
5,"My Dogs Love It! With one dog who'll eat anything and another who's quite finicky it was good to find something they both liked.  Not a ""stand alone"" food, it's meant to be mixed with kibble for a complete diet.  My fussy boy loves it...and he doesn't love much!"
5,gluten free all natural candy Very nice and not sicky sweet; just all natural taste and sweetness. Wonderful that they are gluten free as well. I like to keep some in my purse.
2,"tastes disgusting Even if I put only one teaspoon in a big smoothie, it simply ruins the taste. It is very bitter and dominant! I am sure it is a good product and it might even work and have lots of health benefits, so if you don't mind the taste, go ahead and buy it but I think I would buy the capsules instead (you swallow the good stuff without having to taste it)."
5,"Terrific potato chips Particularly fine product at a competitive price.  Should be carried by major chains for the significant percentage of the population whose doctors recommend reduced sodium intake.  They're losing business when they think there's no market.  I'm sure I am not the only one who has walked past the stores' snack isles for years for lack of an unsalted selection, but I can't buy from an ""empty wagon."""
4,"Full flavored & not bitter 18 pods and great tasting. Was hoping senseo would come back  and amazon did it , now we need pods for under 30 cents"
4,Our dog loves it! I wish they were bigger but our Australian shepherd LOVES it. should have ordered another one because hes had it for an hour and is half way done with it will order more!
4,Wonderful Treat! These treats are great!  They smell wonderful and my dogs love them!  They are also very healthy and great for my dog who is a little over weight as they are low calorie.  The seller was excellent and the treats got here much faster than what was originally estimated.  I would definitely recommend them for anyone with small dogs.  The only downfall is that they are a little pricey but well worth it.
5,"bobbieloepz I am an addict to salty fatty snacks.  I LOVE this stuff.  I bought the 125g jar. I've had it for about a week and it's almost half gone.  Tonight I went on to order 6 more jars.  I might gift one or two of them, but I'm not sure.  I love this so much I may just keep it all for myself.  If you love salty snacks, you might as well get some concentrated  B vitamins to go along with your treat.  The taste reminds me of the Fon that is in the bottom of your skillet when you saute meat or vegetables.  Did I mention that I LOVE this stuff?"
5,"Favorite thing about Brazil I spent the first five years of my life in Brazil and my American parents both spoke Portuguese fluently and introduced me to Brazilian food and culture. This is one of my favorite foods ever, and the lingering memory I have of Brazil. Fluffy, moist and made out of Tapioca flour, these little rolls are nothing like American cheese bread-- seriously they aren't! Its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven, and they're just as fabulous cold.<br /><br />Yoki is the best maker of the dry mix, and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy, delicious treat or side dish. They never turn out wrong."
5,"ZiwiPeak Treats These are the only treats we use for our teacup poodles.  Very hard to get locally, but now we can have them shipped right to our door quickly."
4,"Energy, Sucralose and Fake Cherry Flavors I'm all for energy drinks and occasionally will need that extra push to get through the late afternoon. Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, is not a horrible product overall. I have felt more energetic for about the last week (which is the time period I've been using it) and that's probably due to the vitamins. There's not really that much caffeine in this, so the effect overall is mild.<br /><br />However, that said, the two things that bother me about this product are the flavor and the use of Sucralose.<br /><br />The flavor is reminiscent of Vicks Cherry cough syrup, IMO. Not exactly refreshing and very artificial-tasting. What cherries and punch would taste like if they were made of out plastic.<br /><br />The use of Sucralose is a little disturbing for something that purports to be healthy. Why not use stevia, an all-natural sweetener instead? Zero calories and very sweet, but not man-made and you don't get these fun side affects(from Wikipedia): ""A Duke University study found evidence that doses of Splenda of between 100 and 1000 mg/kg, containing sucralose at 1.1 to 11 mg/kg (compare to the FDA Acceptable Daily Intake of 5 mg/kg), reduced the amount of good bacteria in the intestines of rats by up to 50%, increased the pH level in the intestines, contributed to increases in body weight, and affected the levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)""  OK, I'm not a rat, but still, that is kind of a negative in my book.<br /><br />So, energy: 5 stars<br /><br />Flavor: Minus -.5 stars<br />Sucralose ingredient: -.5 stars"
5,"Yum! I love, love, love the Salt & Pepper Popchips. Have to order them in the individual bags or I will eat the whole thing!!  Thank goodness for portion control :-) 1 bag is only 2 points on WW."
1,"Stone soup To make stone soup, one puts a stone in the pot and then a little onion and a left over carrot and whatever old stuff you have in the refrigertor and maybe a piece of chicken, and by golly, there is a pot of soup! To make this ""creamy"" corn chowder, you add a pint of heavy cream, and then 2-3 potatoes, and 2 quarts (1/2 gallon) chicken broth, and then ""if available, 2-3 ears of corn."" To be fair, the resultant soup tastes good, but, with these ingredients, it should; I just wish I had known what would be called for prior to spending any money. As an alternative, Amazon has a Turtle Island roasted corn chowder that is ""just add water,"" and it is delicious. See <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OREZAG"">Turtle Island Southwestern Roasted Corn Chowder Mix, 5.5-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>."
5,"Wow!  This stuff really works to keep things moving! I've tried this tea before when I visited Chinatown in LA.  This is powerful so be careful not to use it every day.  BUT, it is a new addition to my plant-based cleanse routine.  Try it and you'll agree.  Great!"
5,Best salt & vinegar chips out there! Salt & vinegar chips are my favorite flavor so I think I've tried every brand out there.  These are by far the best.  I also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy.  They seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste.
1,"Gross coffee Just a gross coffee...horrible taste.  Ugh!  Don't buy it or be fooled by good reviews.  Really bitter, acidic, and burnt taste.  The worst coffee i have had."
5,"Ginger candy - yum! I am a ginger fanatic and this is the best candy I have found. Soft, chewy, full of great ginger flavor and 'heat'! And the packaging is the best. With other brands I have tried, while they have been very flavorful, it was difficult to unwrap them without playing tug of war with the wrapping. These are wrapped in powdered parchment and then an outer wrapper, easy to remove and pop in your mouth. And the Amazon 5-pack price cannot be beat. I paid over twice this price in a local health food store. Stock up - they have a long shelf life!"
5,"A must have in my collection My husband and I have become K-cup addicts since I bought him the machine for Christmas. This is my favorite flavor so far. I'm not a strong coffee drinker, and I'm a total sweet-tooth. All this needs is a little splenda and some half/half and the result is a creamy, low-carb delightful treat!"
5,Son and husband love these. Me not so much.  But while I love icee's I don't love the syrups ever.
5,"A puppy pleaser for sure............ Our 10 year old mixed breed loves these treats.  She begins performing her tricks without any prompting when she sees I have the bag.  If I delay in giving them to her she begins to wimper for them.<br />I like the fact that the first two ingredients are chicken and beef which means I am giving her a high quality treat that she loves.<br />Oh did I mention that she is very particular about what she eats?  She is not an eat everything in sight dog and is very choosy about what she its.<br />Let your dog try them,I think your dog will love this treats as much as my dog does."
3,"Just OK The flavor of the chips are good, but the texture is a bit off.  They really douse the chips with Parmesan and herbs, but once you start chewing they start to taste really weird.  I like that they are fairly low calorie (each back is actually 1.5 servings though), so I'll keep eating them.  I'm not sure I would order them again."
5,"Has solved our dog's alergy and GI tract problems 100% Our Husky/Shepherd mix had ongoing GI tract issues, including bleeding out of the rectum and very seriously inflamed lower GI tract (as viewed on a scope). Poor little guy went through so many drugs, and ""prescription"" alergy-dog-foods and just could not seem to solve it.<br /><br />Then researched Eagle Pack and moved him onto this as it was heavily fed by Northern dog racers with similar breeds to ours.<br />""Eagle Pack"" was prior brand name before it changed over to ""Holistic Select"" - but same product.<br /><br />GI issues went away, and our troubled-eater, barfer, bloody-diarrhea pooch is now healthy, happy, and has a great appetite and energy. Yes, it is more expensive, but if you compare the ingredients they are top notch.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about this dry food for solving these issues. My review applies specifically to the Anchovy/Sardine/Salmon recipe."
5,"Delicious -and- satisfying? You got it! These are the typical red bags of premium beef-jerky you see at the store, only...you get FOUR of them! These four bags of delicious, mouth-watering beef nuggets are a tasty and healthy snack, and I don't feel bad about eating a whole bag throughout the day at my desk.<br /><br />I love all of the varieties Jack Link's has to offer. I've been a die-hard Teriyaki fan myself, so I'm hesitant to sway away from my typical ""go-to"" bag.<br /><br />If you're looking for a satisfying feel-good snack to take on road trips, sporting events, at your desk, or what-have-you ' you do NOT want to pass this up."
4,Necta Sweet Tab. The product is what I wanted and expected but 3000 tabs is a bit too much.  It would be nice to have the option to order just one bottle.  These three bottles will be around to go into my estate.
5,"Slurp. It's gone. I discovered Petite Cuisine when I tried to switch my 13-year-old cat from dry food to canned; I tried every variety of canned food, and while he wouldn't touch any other brand, he inhaled this stuff. I'm a vegetarian, but Petite Cuisine looks more like real chicken/fish than anything I've seen - actual, identifiable strips of meat!  What a concept.<br /><br />My new kittens love it as well, and Chicken Pot Pie is by far their favorite flavor.  It's got a little more fat than the fish flavors, but still well within the AAFCO guidelines. It's also a little more expensive; you can usually get 24-packs of fish flavors for $18 if you go to the manufacturer's web site. But the chicken pot pie makes a great treat for a healthy dinner.<br /><br />But: check out Joe's post about menadione."
5,delicious and quick I just moved and was unable to find this product anywhere.  I love this product and my lattes were suffering without it.  Finally I found it on Amazon and my prayers were answered.  The delivery was quick and now my morning coffee is up to par.  Thank you Amazon
2,steaks I ordered these steaks for a party I was having. When I received the steaks I received 12 instead of 16. I contacted Omaha steaks and they said I got what i ordered. I had to file a claim with Amazon to get my issue resolved. The issue was resolved to my satisfaction.
5,WOW Product came right on time and the flowers were beautiful!  The pricing was outstanding! I will definately use them again for my next event.
1,"Poor Quality The 1 Pound LB Madagascar Bourbon Planifolia Extract was not received vacuum sealed as shown and described. This has considerably undermined the quality of the product and its freshness. After contacting the supplier, he gave inadequate and irrelevant reasons as why the item was not vacuum sealed! I guess the supplier since he knew the item has been shipped outside the US, he did not care much about quality and customer rights and satisfaction."
5,Love Newman's organics I trust Newman's Organic products to actually be organic! Good product at a great price. I keep bulk amounts in the house to make crockpot steel cut oatmeal. A good way to get a daily serving of fruit and sweetens the oats without needing additional sugar.
5,jerky this jerky has a great flavor it is fresh and ez to eat when you sink your teeth in it they go rt thru it not like other jerky out there
5,"Cottie seems to love this food (ASIN: B004LWGLQ0)  Cottie is a little cat, approximately 10-12 pounds of love.  I buy 1-2# bags of food so he gets a balance of those foods he refuses to eat in canned form.  With the smaller size, I also keep him from being bored with his diet, which I understand can be a problem for cats.  The larger bags are more economical, but they would hang around for too long, and he would tire of eating what's in them.<br />This is the latest newbie; they are all kept together in one of these huge storage bins with a top that secures very well to the bottom, keeping food fresh and bugs out.<br />I have taken to writing a note for each bag, stating the dates he was fed and what went in bowl #2 (there is no bowl #3, for those of you old enough to recall daytime TV of old.)  The only other thing I could add to this recommendation would be if I were to observe him eating it, and make yet another note of the date he finished the portion.  And do the same for a couple of other foods for comparison purposes."
5,"Really does taste like fresh squeezed! If you compare this w/ the conventional plastic juice lemons found in your grocery store or even the green bottled lemon juices, you will taste a major difference. I think it is due to the added lemon oil. My incentive to purchase this item was mainly for an economical organic lemon juice that I would enjoy and this juice exceeds my expectations. Of course I'd prefer a container such as a small glass bottle like Lakewood organic lemon juice uses but for the price difference I'll keep my fingers crossed that the plastic containers are BPA free. Another plus is Italy is highly regarded for their quality lemons and this product certainly supports that claim. Lemonade anyone?"
2,yuck I don't like diet coke but my husband does and it tastes just like it so if you like diet coke its for you lol
5,Best Cookie...So Full of Chocolate Just got these in today and opened up 2 of the packages to put them in the cookie jar. They were not any broken and they are delicious. So full of chocolate chips!!!! I recommend these to anyone to get. They came to me in a large box with other things I ordered and they were in great shape.
5,Best Ice Wine I've Ever Had I've tried a lot of Ice Wines and this one is by far the best.  It doesn't leave a nasty after taste in your mouth like some of the others.  The taste explodes in your mouth.  Worth the few extra dollars than some of the cheaper ones out there.
4,"weak taste but still good The taste of this is very weak with little actual coffee taste.  I put in some instant coffee crystals and it definitely improved the taste.  The foam is nice, the best foam I've ever seen in an instant drink.  The pumpkin spice flavor is good, too.  Without the added instant coffee it tastes like a frothy milk-only drink and it's too rich for me to finish a cup (made with water; I can't imagine how rich it would be with milk).  Between the rich taste and the calories at about 180 per cup, it's not something you'd want every day."
5,"good stuff Haven't found a dog yet who doesn't like these. But I was hesitant to give it to one terrier we were babysitting who likes to snort her food for fear she might just swallow the thing whole since they pieces are small enough for her to not chew and possibly choke on. That said, my dog loves 'em."
3,"Eh, they're all right These almonds aren't bad--better than just eating regular salted almonds.  But I tried the Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds first, and I like those a LOT more than the Wasabi & Soy.  I found that I got a stronger ""kick"" from the horseradish if I sucked on the almond first before eating it."
5,"Perfect for wedding favors!!! These went great with the ""clear"" pineapple ones for wedding favors I made.  They are delicious!!  The entire wedding party and guests loved them."
4,"very good but These bars are moist and delicious. They aren't too small or too big and leave you feeling satisfied. They aren't full of too many or unknown ingredients. You can taste the fruit and nuts clearly. However, I find them high in fat/saturated fat and calories for their size, and quite sugary on the teeth."
5,"excellent candy floss sugar I have one of the small, Nostalgia-brand cotton candy makers that uses either crushed candy or flossing sugar.  While I like the results of the crushed candy, I've really been craving the more traditional cotton candy flavors, and was curious about the results I'd get with flossing sugar.  I was really pleased!  You do need to take a bit of care to not spill the sugar (because it's so fine, it starts melting instantly, and can be a mess if you miss the target),but the results - flavor, volume, and texture - were fantastic.  Try blending the flavors, too.  We did so, unintentionally, when we first received the sugars: we wanted to try them all, and used one right after the other.  Got some very novel blends that way!  :-)"
4,Good for baking This is a really good product to use in baking as a substitute for fresh eggs. I wouldn't use it for scrambled eggs to eat as they don't taste anything like fresh eggs but a good thing to have on hand.
5,"Low Carb Snack Crackers These crackers are not only 1 carb each, but they are crunchy and taste great. Whether alone as something to snack on or with cheese or humus, they are really good."
4,healthier alternative to Crystal Light cherry pomegranate Have been an addict of CL Cherry Pomegranate for a few years and trying to cut back on artificial sweetners and chemicals.  There's still some in this but feel better that at least I'm getting benefits of green tea.  Hope I'm not fooling myself!
2,"I love gummi bears I really love gummi bears. I saw these online and I had to try them, I have never had pink or blue gummi bears like it shows in the picture, which made me willing to pay the considerable price for them. Well, there aren't any pink or blue gummi's in the bag. My disappointment abounds! I won't buy these again, not at the price I paid. Don't get me wrong, they were really good, I enjoyed eating them, but they weren't everything I hoped for and WAY overpriced."
5,"best salami stateside I lived in Spain and loved the cured meats from there, France and Italy.  While most US made salame's are overly fatty and lack flavor, this brand (all versions) is the best I've had from the USA."
3,Decent flavor Well the creme caramel was on sale so I decided to give it a shot. Plus the fact that each K Cup is individually prepared by Mr. Puck himself. Anyway I quite enjoy these. I never buy flavored ones so overall I'm happy with these but they are definitely not my favorite as I usually buy the bolder ones and these are fairly mild.
5,"Great addition. I choose to give this to my son once a day in addition to the Baby's Only Lactose Free Formula. I like that the DHA comes from a food source and doesn't go through the harsh process that ""life's DHA"" does. It seems to make my son a bit more regular too, which is an added bonus."
5,"Very tasty! I am really a huge advocate of cooking from scratch, with all fresh ingredients, but I really love these seasoning packets especially the one for pork.<br /><br />This has not only nice flavors, but a bit of thickening.  I use it whenever I make split pea soup (one packet of this per 1lb bag of peas and only use half the amount of water they say to use on the bag of peas...beautiful, thick split pea soup every time!) or a pot of beans with ham shanks and it always comes out beautifully flavored.  I don't add salt when I use this but other herbs can be used, of course, with fantastic results.<br /><br />This comes in several other flavors now, but this is the one that I use the most.  Just store the packets in airtight containers, such as Lock & Lock, and they keep practically forever."
5,"Excellent Country Ham Slices I love, love, love good, salty country ham and this product does not disappoint.  It cooks up easily and tastily and is wonderful in hot, fresh, buttered biscuits.  The slices are the perfect shape and size for biscuits, too.  HIGHLY recommended."
3,"I like it; my wife thinks it's so-so Used in conjunction with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9FQ"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>, I think this conditioner does a good job. I have thick, sometimes frizzy hair when it gets hot and humid, and this stuff makes my hair smoother and a little less full-looking, which is what I want. It contains a great shea butter smell that makes me feel like I'm vacationing somewhere exotic.<br /><br />My wife, on the other hand, isn't as keen on this conditioner as me. She feels it leaves a residue that feels heavy and is hard to get out of your hair. To me, the sign of good conditioner is the kind that is hard to get out of your hair with water, but she doesn't like that. Her rating for this product was three stars.<br /><br />The bottle is long and slender and has a convenient pop-up cap that's easy to open and close. I like how the cap end of the bottle is the flat portion that you place down; all the shampoo in the bottle builds toward that end, so you'll never have to hit the back of the bottle to squeeze shampoo out."
5,Tea All of the teas I ordered have been delicious but this one is my favorite.  I know I will be ordering it again.
1,"disappointing, dry and eggy-tasting I've been trying a lot of gluten-free cookies, and these are one of the disappointments.  They're very dry, almost powdery, and the flavor is dominated by what I'd describe as the taste of plain egg whites.  Even the chocolate chips can't make up for it.  Obviously they're working with very little since the product is also non-dairy, but so are Mary's Gone Crackers chocolate chip cookies, and they're delicious and have the consistency of real cookies: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TRGYEW"">Mary's Gone Crackers love Cookies, Chocolate Chip, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I recommend those instead.  I won't buy these again."
4,"Very large flakes This has a great, fresh, finishing salt. I personally prefer Murray River Pink Salt for the more delicate crunch, but I do like this for a change. Try both!"
5,"No more trips to Petco The girls @ the specialty pet food store won't carry IAMS products because they say IAMS contains fillers & are not healthy.  But these are my dogs favorite biscuit treats & the only reason we would go to Petco.  Actually my dog enjoys the trips to Petco because he can wander around & check out all the smells - Oh well, now we have to find other places for him to smell.<br />Occasionally Petco would be out of the Petite biscuits so buying them in bulk from Amazon is a much better option.  Less expensive too.<br /><br />If the girls @ the specialty pet food store are correct - I cannot say.  All I know is we have been feeding these biscuits to my dog since I got him & we have not evidenced any ill effect.  Actually those girls won't sell any Science Diet or Purina products either - they too apparently have fillers."
5,"Tea for Creative Moods Numi's tea sampler has a lot to offer if you enjoy mild teas. If you prefer stronger teas, then you may want to creatively mix and match for a new experience.<br /><br />Delicate Tea for Calm Mornings<br /><br />The Numi ""Morning Rise,"" organic breakfast blend has elements of smooth perfection when blended with milk powder or cream. This tea has a mild dreamy flavor when using one teabag. You may want two if you prefer a stronger morning blend. If you are looking for an elegant tea, this blend of Fair Trade Certified Keemun, Darjeeling, Ceylon and Assam black tea is sure to impress. Morning Rise is a delicate tea that awakens you slowly to the day and seems to bring a new clarity to the mind.<br /><br />Dreamy Vanilla<br /><br />Numi teas are blended to an elegant perfection. Numi ""Decaf Black Vanilla"" is no exception and will please anyone who loves mild black tea with a hint of vanilla. For a richer experience, use two teabags per 8-ounce cup. This tea is perfect for drinking at night when you are relaxing, reading poetry or starting a new novel. The vanilla flavor is enhanced with a dash of cream or even an little vanilla syrup from France. I can recommend Rieme French Vanilla syrup or even a cane sugar to add a caramel twist.<br /><br />Delicate Ginger with hints of Anise<br /><br />Numi ""Golden Chai"" is a delicately spiced Assam black tea that I like to blend with the Numi ""Chinese Breakfast"" tea made with Yunnan black tea. Together they seem perfect and I like using two teabags per experience. This creates a flowery tea scented with anise and cardamom and spiced with cinnamon and ginger. If you like making chai with milk, heat some milk in a saucepan and then add one or two teabags. It is much more convenient than having to look around for all the separate ingredients and the spices and tea are perfectly blended.<br /><br />Afternoons in Africa<br /><br />Bushmen's Brew ""Honeybush,"" ""Jasmine Green Tea"" and ""White Nectar Osmanthus Spring"" make a good combination for a honey/floral tea. Adding in a little honey enhances the experience. With this blend you can enjoy white tea with Osmanthus flowers, green tea with jasmine flowers and honeybush tea with a mild flavor. You may enjoy this as an ice tea in the summer.<br /><br />Lemon Iced Mint Tea<br /><br />Numi's ""Gen Mai Cha"" Toasted Rice Green, Simply Mint ""Mooccan Herbal Teasan"" and Rainforest Green ""Mate Lemon Myrtle Green Tea"" can be steeped together to create a delicious tea to pour over ice. Add honey while the tea is hot and lemon juice just before serving.<br /><br />The Lemon Iced Tea was the best experience of all the teas<br /><br />and I can see myself buying a box of each tea so I can make<br /><br />this tea again.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
4,"there are affordable teabags and there are affordable teabags nothing comes realatively cheap these days and still get the satisfaction.  I love stash tea, as it presents both good value (via amazon) and offers a little luxury amongst its peers.  There are more expensive brands, but as a brand, this one cuts about the rest.  I love the chamomile version and it is a sure winner in the taste section too. Highly recommend and thanks amazon for making it so affordable."
5,These really work and all dogs seem to like the taste too! These really work to mask a pill.  I haven't seen a dog yet that didn't like them either.  They do smell good I must say!
4,"Made in China but my dogs love them! I am looking for other sweet potato treats that are made in USA. I would feel more comfortable.  Having said that, my many little toy dogs do love these, even two older ones who have lost their teeth.  They just suck on them until they are real soft then swallow the soft parts. The treats themselves are rigid, some are bendable. I add a little water to a bag to  soften them first and it works. I worry about my little guys choking on them but they haven't.  Sure beats those awful rawhide treats I use to give them. I quit when one of my dogs almost choked to death on one.You have to be careful, if you do add water to refrigerate these so they don't get bacteria build up. Sweet Potato chews are just the best idea ever. Why did it take so long? Too bad we can't depend on things from China, but that is just the way it is."
5,"a yummy healthy snack! I have been craving candy and this is a super answer; they taste great and have super ingredients. Also try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PICX42"">Annie's Homegrown Berry Patch Organic Bunny Fruit Snacks, 5-Count Pouches (Pack of 4)</a> I prefer the citrus."
5,"We LOVE this tea! I make this tea two quarts at a time and then cool in the fridge for an ""iced"" tea drink. My whole family, even my kids love this tea. I do sweeten it with stevia and add a couple drops of pure vanilla extract, but of all the flavored teas we have tried, this is our favorite:)"
5,"Dog's favorite Our golden retriever has so many allergies.  These treats fit the bill.  No additives, no preservatives and he loves them.  What could be better."
4,"Tasty though hardly a revelation, and rather expensive After reading the other reviews here I was expecting some sort of curry revelation from this Rendang. But dang, Ren and Stimpy, it was merely quite good, maybe very good for a packaged curry. It's got some layers of taste but nothing approaching a freshly home-made curry, and miles from a serious restaurant. And at almost 7 per package, if you buy four, this is hardly a bargain.<br /><br />First problem: it's barely spicy. I don't need nuclear but I do want heat from a curry. This has little if any. Second issue for me was the packaging. Squeeeezing this paste out of the army-rations-type foil pouch made me feel like my unit was going to be deployed at any second. Maybe that's just me...but it also made it hard to get all the contents out without serious rolling and some mess on the hands. Far from ideal. Plus the bay leaves were kind of a hassle to deal with; they certainly are key to the taste but while the full leaves are easy to find, the smaller pieces make for some weird chewy moments. Don't swallow...<br /><br />From a pure taste perspective, it's a good Rendang but if you've ever had a truly fresh one made with fresh spices, not just a paste, then you know the difference. At seven clams for less than two servings, I'd say go to your local gourmet Indian or Thai place and get the real deal.<br /><br />But, if there is no such option nearby and you love Rendang, then this is certainly a decent alternative. I just don't think it's that far beyond Mae Ploy or the other packaged curry stalwarts, and they cost literally a third or so what this does, plus you can use fresh coconut, and you won't need to add more spices on your own to get it close to real curry heat."
5,"Fantastic snack I've tried the big sheets before and liked them but thought they were to big and messy.  These are perfect snack size and I love the salty onion flavor.  They are fun to eat, sort of like cotton cant where you let it melt on your tongue.  I didn't think these would be very filling since they are like little paper sheets but surprisingly after one pack I'm satisfied."
5,Zico Pure Coconut Water Excellent product and the taste is heavenly! I got the Mango flavored-- I WILL be ordering more.<br />Product arrived timely and in great shape.  Description of product was excellent!  Will use seller again!<br />A.L. Walton
5,MILANO ORANGE&lt; MY FAVORITE !!!! By the time I buy a few four packs and get amazons free shipping to my door it is a better deal than my local store.Its a wonderful crispie cookie that holds up well in shipping Try it for yourselves  :)
5,"Simple way to enjoy quality product. Just thought I would share a way I enjoy these.<br /><br />I put about a tablespoon nibs in the magic bullet, grind them up.<br /><br />Put about a teaspoon of ghee (grassfed clarified butter) I get organic from healthfood store and 1 teaspoon to a tablespoon raw organic honey (unfiltered and unprocessed) in a custard cup.<br /><br />I let the mixture melt a bit in toaster oven set at 105 degrees. Yeah it's a raw foodist idea. (minus the ghee)<br /><br />Stir it up into a little ball after the ghee and honey soften. Enjoy slightly warm or for a different texture, throw in the fridge to reharden.<br /><br />Simple, quick, perfect little power food.<br /><br />I'm not a calorie counter, but this is a small amount and I feel great having it.<br /><br />Quality calories count. :)"
4,"No Trans-Fat, Yummy but fattening I have this in a large container that says no trans-fat on it, same brand and everything... It is some good stuff. Not for daily consumption but easily tastes as good as, if not better than, the $4 drinks at the Bigbucks coffee place. Add some coffee and ice and blend it really well because the chocolate chips are pretty persistent, and you're good to go. Nice, rich coffee flavor. Yum!!!"
5,MY PUPPY LOVES THESE THINGS!!!! Ever since I got my new puppy we have given her these treats to help her with the teething.  They certainly<br />do work.  She LOVES them and always looks forward to her next treat!!!
5,"ADDICTED!!! Traditionally I bake my own sweets, but these are the best boxed cookies I've ever had!  I'm addicted! I have tried the Lemon, Cinnamon, and Chocolate Vanilla Swirl and I like the last one the best..."
5,"Bye Bye Mole! First tried the sonic spikes and poison since that was what was available at the local Home Depot but after two weeks, the mole was still alive and I was frustrated. When the mole decided to move into my garden, it was the last straw. I got this trap along with the more expensive Wire Tek 1001. Set the Wire Tek out in hopes that I could just use one trap and return this one. But after a day, I hadn't caught it yet so I decided to deploy both. Moved the Wire Tek to a new location and put the Victor in it's place. I followed the instructions that came with it and within 12 hours, the Victor had a dead mole in its jaws. Easy to use, effective, and permanent solution for moles!"
5,"Very Good Peanut Butter This is very good peanut butter. It was on a special price, which was the reason I decided to try it. I usually buy the jif regular creamy peanut butter."
5,Love these These bags are great. They fit so much in them. I had a whole cart full of groceries and I only used 4 bags. They are very sturdy and can hold heavy items. I would always forget to bring those big reusable bags that you can buy in the grocery store. These are great because I can just throw them in my purse. They roll up really small. Everyone always asks where I got them from because of the cool designs too. :)
4,"If you love coconut you'll love this product I'm somewhat obsessed with coconuts, considering I was born in a tropical island  :-). I discovered this juice while shopping at my local organic supermarket and immediately felt in love wit the texture and taste, which has the consistency of coconut milk. My favorite coconut drinks are Taste Nirvana Coco Aloe and the Lakewood Organic Coconut juice (which is organic and fleshed pressed). I bought a pack of 6 and literally finished it within a week lol.<br /><br />My only complaint is I wish they made them ONLY out of fresh pressed coconuts instead of adding other juices like Pear and Apple. Other than that it doesn't take away the rich coconut flavor. Will buy tons of these if there weren't so expensive too."
3,"Heavy on the Vinegar I usually love Kettle Chips, and love salt & vinegar, but these chips were way too vinegary for me! They do have the typical kettle chip crunch, but are too aggressively flavored for my taste."
5,"Great for your heart I got a few packages of these... used some for my daughter (for the Omega-3 fatty acids, as they help with brain function... she is speech impaired) and for my grandpa (who has high blood pressure & had a stroke.)<br /><br />You simply add a few spoonfuls to your oatmeal... my grandpa's cholesterol went down 50 points in one month. (None of his medication had been able to do that.)<br /><br />My 5 y.o. daughter didn't notice this in her oatmeal... I tried it, and there is no added taste, just health benefits :)<br /><br />Great product. We always have it at our house."
5,"Earth's Best variety pack Our primary reason for buying this product is that it came in a variety pack.  We make most of our own baby food, but we were going on vacation and that was going to be difficult.  Since packing space was limited, we had this shipped to our destination.  It was the only brand we could find to order in a variety pack.  The kids liked all the flavors and the consistency seemed good."
5,"Fresh Great Taste I am a tea lover and am not really a coffee drinker.  However, the new single serve pods of Marley Coffee caught my attention.  I really enjoyed this coffee.  It had a fresh great taste that was not over powering or too strong like some coffee can be.  It can be consumed black or with sweetners...it was great both ways.  As I drank my cups and read the box...I was pleased to learn that farm workers are treated ethically and that partial proceeds from the sale of this coffee goes towards youth soccer programs (kicksforcause.org).  If you enjoy coffee, then you must try this 100% Arabica coffee bean/Artisan Roasted. Uhm Uhm Good!"
5,"Mr Greenjeans would be happy I ""planted"" the pods about a month ago in my Aerogarden.  First time I've used the garden.  In a few days green shoots appeared.  By 2 weeks they were little plants.  Last week I was able to harvest the first of the crop.  Good tasting, easy to grow, always ready.  A great buy.  The instruction booklet that came with the pods covers everything I ned to know about growing basil.  A very good deal"
4,"Love them now - not so much earlier I first tried these with my twins when they were starting on solid food.  I figured they liked yogurt, so they'd probably like these.  And they did, but only for the first couple of bags.  Fast forward a few months when they spotted an unopened bag and pointed... now they love them!  Afternoon snack often features ""yoga melts"" along with a happy dance."
4,"Pritikin Soup Excellent low sodium soup - good substitute for a light lunch or supper.  With a salad or some bread, a very satisfying meal.<br />Punta Gorda, Florida"
1,"Causes Health Problems in long run.... I have always fed my cats dry food, never wet food, well now that I'm a little older and I can afford to buy them wet food as a treat, I had been feeding them canned food for about a year, before I started to feed them the canned food one of my cats had his blood tested because of his age, everything was good he was healthy. I had to take him in for an infection he has in his eye the vet said we should do another blood test to see where he's ""at"". Now all of a sudden he has Thyroid Problems, the vet said that it may have been because of the lining these cans have to preserve the food inside of them. That may have caused the Thyroid problems. I will never give my babies canned food. I have switched them to the pouched food, or the frozen food in plastic they sell at Whole Foods. Here is the website I found information on Thyroid Problems for Cats. [...]<br />Simon is an old man, almost 20, so I understand it was inevidable, but not something that was caused by me. I feel so bad, I love my baby. Thanks for reading."
5,"Fast, easy and Yummy! I'm so happy to see Betty Crocker making GF mixes!  I've made this cake twice and it's turned out great (Even my husband, who is not Gluten Intolerant, loves it)! And thanks, BC, for your canned icing being GF as well!  Now it's quick and easy to make a nice dessert that GF and tastes wonderful!"
4,"Beautiful Hot Mess So when I got these in the mail, I opened the package and felt like a lunchlady opening the door on what was mere moments ago an epic food fight.<br /><br />Goo, slop and general dishevelment.<br /><br />So having these delivered on a warm Florida day through the mail seems (at least in my one-time experience) to be not the best idea.<br /><br />That said -<br /><br />I was not expecting much - AT ALL. Gimmicky ""remixes"" of established classics...in my experience, a recipe for disappointment (Monterey Jack Cheez-Its anyone? I didn't think so...blecchh!)<br /><br />But these are like Girl Scout Tagalongs, except ""all year long.""<br /><br />In fact, they are MORE chocolatey, because of the chocolate (and not shortbread) cookie inside.<br /><br />The chocolate covering was surprisingly fudgy with a fuller chocolate body and flavor than I ever would have expected.<br /><br />The peanut butter filling is delightful, nicely balanced and sweet but still rich.<br /><br />So basically if you are a fan of Tagalongs and also a fan of chocolate, these represent a beautiful little crossroads.<br /><br />Just order them on a cool day. :)"
5,"a pleasure to drink this Matcha is high in quality and taste.  it is fragrant, has an abundance of flavor, no bitterness whatsoever, and it goes down smooth.  it comes in a thick sealed foil-type bag inside of a vacuum-sealed tin, and mixed in with the Matcha is a silica gel packet which keeps the Matcha humidity-free and fresh...this sort of packaging it top-notch.  it produces a very thick foam when whisked and is a pleasure to consume.  see pics i posted for a close-up view."
5,"Great product! We've been using these bags for almost two years, and we love them. They look and feel like thin stretchy plastic, and they are surprisingly strong. I even accidentally ran a few through the washer & dryer, and they worked fine. These come in two sizes, and I recommend trying a bag with the same dimensions before buying in bulk. Well worth the few pennies per bag to reduce the environmental impact."
5,"Super Peanut Butter Bars I really, really love peanut butter, and could just eat it by the spoonful.  Too many snack bars just mix peanut butter in with other things in order to hold the peanut butter together and keep it from gooping all over your hands.<br /><br />These bars were just what I needed.  Peanut butter on the bottom, with a bar of peanuts on the top.  It ends up tasting just like some extra super chunk peanut butter with the peanuts crunching in your mouth while the oozy goodness of peanut butter clings to your tongue.  I think Planters snuck some other grains and such in there, but you wouldn't know it from the flavor.<br /><br />I haven't checked out the fat content on these bars, and I can only assume they are bad for you, like most delicious things.  They might be a notch up from your average candy bar in terms of health, but I really don't know.  What I do know, is that they are delicious, and if you are a peanut butter fan you will find this a little bar of heaven."
5,"You mean I can pig out on these things and not hate myself?! +Natural; no weird ingredients or pesticides<br />+Crunchy and sweet with a hint of cinnamon. If you like the taste of apples, you'll like these.<br />+Healthy; I can inhale half a bag and not feel the urge to hibernate through the summer to burn off the calories.<br /><br />-Inconsistent hardness. Some pieces are a bit on the softer side (more of a chewy/crunchy rather than shatter-your-fillings crunchy) while others will make your ears ring from how crunchy they are. I personally don't have a problem with this, but some might.<br />-Apple skin seems necessary."
5,Love it! I just love Caffe D'Vita products.  Hawaiian Mocha has  a hint of coconut and tastes great.  Very smooth.
4,nice assortment nice assortment and number of decafinated coffees.  Flavored decaf seems harder to come by so was happy to try a few new ones. Most K-cups are certified kosher.  there were a few in this assortment that were not so gave those away :(  otherwise pleased with price and fast arrival
1,Ajiika Organic Roasted Paprika Powder DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  There are no seals around or under the lids.  The lids on both paprikas and on fennel (also this brand) came loose during shipment spilling the contents.  I do not feel safe using these products but they cannot be returned.  I'm waiting to hear from Amazon on whether or not I can at least get a refund.
3,"Interesting and Entertaining, but tea flowers are really single-use This is an interesting item and a great conversation piece. The bamboo box and packaging has a handmade feel about it; the box itself is something you can leave on a table or counter. The teapot seems a bit fragile and seems to be made of an extremely cheap glass, and I often wonder if it could crack during use.<br /><br />The teas are acceptable, if not extremely flavorable. Unlike tea bags or loose teas, you really can't steep these teas to your desired strength. This can be a problem if you like really strong tea.  The ""flowers"" themselves, although they can be reused 2 or 3 times according to the instructions, are really only ""single use"". They are difficult to dry, and subsequent pots of tea are weaker than the first.  In general, I thought the teas were bitter.<br /><br />I'd recommend this for a tea enthusiast, but only as a novelty. It's not an extremely high-quality item. It's good, though, if you want to experiment with different teas in a unique way."
4,"Greta tasting. Lots of noodles. Lots of noodles here.  I like the Nongshim brand, it is not like those instant noodles that are mostly packed with air.  Once cooked, you will find the noodles brimming to the top.<br /><br />I just open the lid halfway, pour three-quarters of the seasoning packet, pour some boiling water and then let it stand for 5 minutes.  The next time I open it, I give it a little stir and I stare on it  for another good 5 minutes.<br /><br />Try to include some real pieces of chicken or pork meat, some Thai brocolli, and some hard boiled eggs.  That's the meal."
5,"THEY'RE G R E A T! How does anyone NOT like Frosted Flakes?  I know, I know, they're sugary, but if you're hungry for a little somethin' late night, you can not or will not find anything that completes that little naggin' hunger..GOOD STUFF in moderation."
5,"How many tomatoes in that itty bitty can? Muir Glen Organic Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes are excellent! Usually, one chooses between diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste--but these are fire roasted tomatoes. Muir Glen used to make fire roasted tomatoes in adobo sauce, luckily there's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011T8XGW"">La Costena Chipotle Adobo Sauce, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> For adobo clarification, it's the Latin American kind, not the Filipino vinegar-based kind.<br /><br />These tomatoes are delicious in the Mexican breakfast eggs in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/140132360X"">Jamie's America: Easy Twists on Great American Classics, and More</a>, the chocolate/coffee chili at the website for <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AFQRG"">VegNews</a> They are quite versatile. Deborah Madison, who once helmed <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767908236"">The Greens Cookbook: Extraordinary Vegetarian Cuisine from the Celebrated Restaurant</a>, the vegetarian establishment run by the San Francisco Zen Center, recommends these.<br /><br />Muir Glen tomatoes are worth what they put in the itty bitty can! Fire roasted and fiery! They taste good... and are good for you."
5,"Thought I would hate it I have 4a/b/c hair and have read tons of materials about which products are best for our hair type. I thought that it was best to get away from petroleum,  and mineral oil, which are the two main ingredients in the Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm. However, I gotta go with what I know and not what I read. This stuff works!! It totally coats and seals in moisture for my porous, dry quickly hair. It is VERY light and a little goes a long way. Now, when I was growing up, everybody had long, flowing hair, when their mama's greased their scalp twice a week and they wore protective styles. What did our mama's grease our scalp with? THIS STUFF, minus the shea butter. I'm going back to the old school ways with a new school twist on it."
1,"Not as good as it could be (misleading ingredient label also) A number of us earnestly tried this product but after trying another brand, found this to be wanting very much.<br /><br />  With that said, there is a company making soy jerky that has better flavor, texture and quality. They even make jerky that is unsweetened. Most importantly, this company tasty eats does not have any garlic or onion powder in any of their products.<br /><br />  This was the biggest, we felt, downfall of this product. Except this company, every jerky company; except tasty eats which uses no garlic or onion powder in any of their product line, all would list garlic or onion if an ingredient. The primal strips company has ""vegetarian spices"" so one is not clear what this is. Even the company, after phoning them, are rather reticent about saying if their is granulated garlic or onion. But there is. In these primals strips, all are having some form of garlic, possibly onion.<br /><br />  We found tasty eats soy jerky to be Perfect. Really, in quality, texture and also the fact that they use no onion or garlic whatsoever."
5,"So Happy :-D I'm so happy I can finally enjoy my Nescafe in the morning, couldn't find this product in US.<br />It is just the best taste!"
4,"Nice balance Not a big fan of flavored coffee, bought these for my wife. Has a nice coffee base flavor, and the vanilla isn't overwhelming or cloying."
5,"Stellar product I have been drinking coffee for a long time. Years ago, I tried pretty much all the instant coffee brands available in the main stream stores. I didn't care for any of them. My husband is a serious coffee lover and would buy a variety of organic coffees: he would grind the beans in the morning, smell their rich aroma and make himself a cup of coffee. I tried all the brands he bought and was always dissatisfied with the slight bitterness that always lingered. He tried to reduce the amount of beans per cup all the way down to 11 grams. And still, I could taste that slight bitterness that I didn't care for.<br /><br />Eventually, I stopped drinking coffee altogether and switched to non caffeinated coffee substitutes made of roasted barley and chicory.<br /><br />Then we went on vacation this summer and my husband bought a jar of Mount Hagen Instant Coffee for convenience in a health food store. It was nothing short of a revelation. It was smooth, tasty and had none of the bitterness I have come to associate with coffee. I drink mine with raw milk and a little sugar and absolutely love it. It also dissolves easily in cold water if you like ice coffee. It is extremely convenient when travelling. As it is, my husband and I like it so much that he has decided to stop buying any other kind of coffee.<br /><br />I seriously doubt you can make 60 cups out of one jar and at $11.99/jar in the health food stores, it is quite pricey.  However, at $8.25/jar at Amazon if you buy the pack of 6, it is more than affordable if you value your coffee. And of course, it is organic coffee and it is the only brand of organic instant coffee available in the U.S. This brand also comes in a decaffeinated variety."
5,"Delicious with a great scent This is a delicious, distinctive tasting tea with a wonderful scent. It even has a nice, rich red color. There are a lot of cinnamon-based spiced teas on the market, but this one is my favorite because it has more sophistication and depth to it. Highly recommended."
3,Goes good with milk :) My kids really like to eat the quaker oatmeal soft cookies in the morning<br /> for breakfest with a big glass of milk! :)
5,"I love Organic Valley milk! I love all of Organic Valley's products. This is white milk.  Not sure what I can say about it other than it's really good.  Even their lowfat milks have a richness about them that makes them seem closer to whole milk.  There is also more flavor there.  Can't explain it.  That's just the way I perceive it.<br /><br />I also prefer to purchase from Organic Valley as it is a cooperative of dairy farmers and not an agri-business such as Horizon, which is part of Dean Foods. (There has also been some debate as to whether or not Horizon's products are really organic.)"
5,"Yum! helped me kick the caff habit I bought this product because I wanted to wean myself off caffeine.  At least, the caff in coffee - I still drink black tea.  Teecino helped because the flavor is so satisfying. By the way, I've only tried Vanilla Nut.  It has an excellent aroma and brews up nicely in my press.  At first I'd mix about a tablespoon of coffee in with it, but now I've dwindled down to about a teaspoon.  Great stuff - no weird aftertaste, tastes like a vanilla latte."
5,Doggie Crack! My dog goes crazy over these treats!  They are like doggie crack!  If you want to really reward your dog and show them love you'll be happy with the Free Range Treats.  I cannot purchase these in any of my local stores so I'm very happy there are available on Amazon!
5,"Tastes great! This protein drink tastes great, and I only make it with water.  It's probably be even better in a smoothie."
5,"This is the perfect sugar alternative We have used this product exclusively for the last 3 months and my family loves it! It does not have the after taste that is so common with other sugar replacements. It measures and tastes like sugar. If there was a negative with this item it would be the price but using it sparingly, the way we should use sugar, has been very effective. I must say that I did pay $17 for my first bag from a local health food store so, comparatively speaking, this is not that expensive. I would recommend this to anyone for use on or in anything that is usually sweetened with sugar."
5,"Crispy granola, finally I bought this because I've read that it's used to keep baked items crisp.<br />I make granola with honey, so I know what's in it and to keep down the cost.  I substituted some of the honey with this, and it works great."
5,"Perfect!  Convenient for kids! These are great!  My daughters love to drink milk and these are great!  They do not require refrigeration and are great to have when traveling, a day out, etc.  We took a case on a cruise because my daughters have to have their milk when they wake up and room service would take too long.  My girls are now 7 and 4 and they still love these!  I only wish they packaged the Light Silk this way!"
5,"I saw a difference in my dog I gave my  14 year old terrier these treats and really believe that these have helped him to feel better. He has lately been playing with his ball, (he self plays and had not been doing this for years) happy to watch him on long walks. He is very happy to keep walking. He is doing very well"
5,"The best instant tea mix My family & I have tried all the various flavors out there and this one is by far the best! We all love it!!! Additionally, you can rarely find this particular flavor at your local grocery so buy it here."
5,"It's really hard to believe they could be this good!! I have been a fan of the Kettle Bakes for a long time now.  They truly are the best chips available anywhere.  In my opinion they are far better in every way than any brand of fried potato chips, not counting Fritos, which aren't potato chips anyway.  I don't see how they could really be improved.  The crunch is fantastic, the flavor is fantastic, and you sacrifice nothing but greasy fingers!  I have tried every flavor, and my favorite is definitely the Aged White Cheddar, but you won't see me turn my back from the BBQ, or the Lightly Salted.  The Salt and Pepper flavor is a bit peppery, so if you like that then you'll like them, and I even eat them sometimes.  The Salt and Vinegar doesn't work for me, but then I'm not a fan of vinegar potato chips anyway.<br /><br />Just buy these, please, any flavor that tickles your fancy.<br />And then you can thank me later.<br />=)"
5,"Absolutely the Best! Easily the best jams, jellies, and preserves anywhere. Taste the fruit more richly and vibrantly than any other maker! I come back again and again."
5,"Did a 360 on 479 Popcorn I am a college student, but even I wouldn't mind occasionally shelling a bit to get this great gift or snack. Originally, when I heard of it at a party, I thought it would be like any other popcorn. Yet, when I first had a kernel, it was airy and melted right in your mouth. Unlike other regular caramel popcorn, this one wasn't too sickly sweet and I could eat it all day."
5,"Sr. Lab loves this food!! Our 12+ yr old lab has been a finnicky eater for the past few years.  I've tried anything and everything to get her to eat. This food was new at our grocery store and I thought I'd give it a try.  She loves it!!!  This is the first 'dry'  dog food she eats without any extras ( fruit, veggies, meats etc)  Yesterday, the first day, she ate approx 4 cups of this food, typically she doesn't eat that much.  Well, let's see if that was a fluke, this morning she ate another 2 cups.  This food isn't really dry, it's a bit moist.  It smells great.  I can't believe our dog is eating it, much less so much of it.  I plan on getting the larger size bag from Amazon and trying some of the treats."
5,"Tasty for people too. It's not convenient for me to get organic chicken where I live, so I tried these.  They go great in a crock pot, or you can put them in a cold sauce and they will soften up fine.  They are yummy.  My cat loves them too."
5,"OMG these are the best These are quite possibly the best snack that was ever invented. The perfect size for a quick bite, or to get you through the day. You'll need a nice glass of milk to wash them down.<br /><br />The cake itself tastes just like an Oreo cookie, but better somehow. The creme center is the real deal. I buy these whenever they're on sale, and take every box the store has. Now that amazon has them, I'm going to get them here!"
5,"soothing Maybe this is a placebo effect however, since I have been drinking this tea, sometimes in the morning and some times at night, I have felt more calm and my mood is somewhat lifted. The taste is fine- I sometimes add a little honey but it is fine as is. I will continue to use this tea. I do think it helps with your mood."
5,one of the Best ! Sahale makes several nut mixes but the Valdosta blend is one of the Best.<br /><br />Just enough pepper and sweet to satisfy with a small handful.<br /><br />We always keep it on hand.
5,superstar! Taste good and it's cheap. if you are into ramen noodles these won't disappoint. $5.04 for a pack of 24 is the cheapest I found plus free shipping.
5,"Easy and delicious I tried this sauce with brisket and with chuck roast. Both were delicious. Even my two-year-old asked for seconds. We served the meat with corn tortillas, cilantro, onions, and avocado for an easy weeknight meal"
5,"Amazing Honey Another great tssting honey variety. Delicate, sweet, smoothe, hints of fruit berries. Really nice, goes well with breads, oatmeal and teas."
4,"Better than many, yet still disappointing We all can see that these are mass produced processed cookies destined to sit on grocery store shelves and occasionally find their way into one's basket and eventually tummy.  In that context, these are good enough, but they fair to excite or live up to the promises implied in the packaging.  That being said, you can do far worse in the cookie aisle, and these may do the trick for you, just don't expect more than these can offer."
5,"Simply Outstanding This is by far the best coffee I've ever tasted.  I drink coffee black so I'm a comparison shopper for gourmet beans.  While it is expensive, you can taste the difference.  It definitely has a woodsy flavor with no aftertaste.  It's pure.<br /><br />Although I wouldn't drink it every day - it's an awesome treat and highly recommended for those that can appreciate it."
5,"fab healthy snack! its sooo good. yummy, filling, natural. what more could you ask for!"
5,Best coffee ever. My husband is a hard man to please when it comes to coffee.  I have tried numerous brands and blends to no avail.  Green Mtn. has hit the nail on the head with it's Dark Magic.  Thank you ever so much.
5,"Great gentle energy boost! And healthy! My sister started to use this during inventory time's long shifts.  Her triglycerides were sky high before she started her half a bottle, not even every day. When she went back to her doctor, her level had dropped from over 400 to right around 200!  On no medications!  Her doctor says it's due to the niacin.  She told me about the energy boost, since I have Parkinson's Disease and between that & the medications, it was hard to keep up with work.  I love it!  And at these prices I can afford it!"
5,"These are great! I really liked these dried berries. They have a 12 month shelf life and I have used them in pancakes, smoothies, and trail mixes.<br /><br />PS. Unlike the last reviewer I read the ingredients listing before I purchased these. Very simple."
5,Vanilliful! These are a great item and a great price.  They were extreemly fresh which is the biggest propble I have had with most other beens in this price range.  My whole house smells of vanilla!  I recommend them to everyone!  :)
5,"Mellow Rich French Roast +++ I just got a sample [3-ounce bag] of this ""Dark French Roast"" via mail -- and brewed it immediately via Gevalia drip machine to full European expresso concentration. It indeed has the rich deep dark chocolate aspect of a traditional Dark French Roast -- but not bitter [beyond the strong dark roast aspect] and indeed no notable acidic aspect. As for drinking modes -- I tried it hot and black by itself [not at all my usual way] -- hot with brown sugar and a little cream -- then cold with lots of cream and ice -- and finally with real French vanilla added to that, for a full French Latte. It was good all these ways -- rich and mellow. I do not have acid problems -- BUT am more of an English or Irish tea drinker -- SO a bit suspicious [and picky] as for coffee variants. This ""Puroast Low Acid Coffee"" variant is indeed way okay +++"
5,"Puppy love My three month old yorkie mix, Gizmo absolutely loves these treats. Every time he hears the bag crinkle he would run up and sit patiently waiting for his treat. They sell Purebites at my local petshop along with various hollistic brand dog food, so I know it's good. When Gizmo became picky about eating his kibble a pet shop worker suggested I sprinkle pieces of this onto the kibble, and it worked wonders for his appetite. The chicken is easiest on his stomach, I've noticed with too much liver Purebites he begins to have diarhia. Otherwise, I higly recommend this."
2,"Disappointing and expensive Thought these would taste much better than a standard box mix, especially for the price.  Extremely sweet - both the frosting and the cake.  And the frosting is not the pink color depicted in the picture on the box.  Only very slightly pink.  The cupcakes taste neither like white chocolate, nor like raspberry.  Save your money!"
5,"Excellent! This Organic soup faithfully recreates the French style, has a very pronounced flavor to it, highly recommended and unique, not your average Vegetable soup, perhaps Amy's best soup of all."
5,Miss those nuts Really enjoy those Redskins. Realy disappointment that Planters discontinued those big cans. Now I have to buy small ones frequently. Let's get them back.
5,"Excellent quality We have ordered these through Amazon twice now, and have been very satisfied both times.  We've had no problems with expiration dates, and the product is good--the anchovies are whole, and have good flavor.  If you use a lot of anchovies, this is a very convenient way to purchase and store them."
2,"I know where it is cheaper I guess you can say i purchased this for the container, because in the end this is too expensive.  In 7-11 these are 99 cents each, here I had to pay $1.29 each.  So just get this to get the container and purchase it @ your nearest 7-11"
5,next best thing to sliced bread I love these brown rice noodles.  The tinkyada brand doesn't stick like the others.  My cholesterol has diminished since switching from regular noodles.
1,"MY DOG HATED THEM My little dog wouldn't even lick it, she isn't going to even get close to it.  Beware!  She loves her treats and I was hoping after reading the other reviews that it would be good for her and her breath, but what a waste of $5.  So frustrated!<br /><br />Just a friendly warning, you might have to send them back."
5,YUMMMMM!!!! We have three darling Shitzus.  All of them adore Booda Bones and look forward to this wonderful treat.  Thank you Amazon!!
5,Great Fun I gave this to my dad for father's day and he got a real kick out of it. A great gift.
5,"Better than Bacon! 1000% better than the Kippers you get at the Super Market.  These are delicious and the smoked flavor makes these a delicious cross between smoked bacon and sardines.  But these Smoked Herring are better than bacon.  Delicious, buy these and give them a try, they will fly off the kitchen shelf and make a great breakfast."
5,"My yorkiepoo loves these. I love that they are healthy for her.  She's tiny so a treat like this is almost a meal for her.  She is learning to be well-behaved thru use of this treat, among others.  Costco did have some recently, but they change their offerings all the time."
5,Great coffee I use 1 box of 50 kcups per month on amazons autoship and I love it. Good coffee for good price.
2,Too rich I fed my champion Shetland Sheepdogs this food for over six months.  A few of my dogs did alright on it but others had loose stools and lost on average 2 pounds from the previous year. Upon giving more food to gain weight the dog's got even looser stools.  I e-mailed the company about it and never got a reply. Coats were shiny but not good enough for show competition.  Since taking my dogs off this food they have gained weight and coats are coming in to the point I can show them again soon.  I do like the philosphies of this company with regards to ingredients but makes me wonder if no grain at all is such a great thing.
3,"Taste good but not quite Thai Spicy I am an expat living in Thailand so I know a thing or two about Thai spicy. While the jerky I received was moist and flavorful, I would not consider it a true Thai taste profile. Although there was a hint of Thai spice, there was no redolent Thai flavor starring in the jerky. At the same time the heat level was what I would call a small baby 1 on a scale of one to ten. I don't think the heat level would have even bothered a baby. Being labeled Thai spicy and living in Thailand I expected this product to deliver a wallop of flavor and, unfortunately, I got a small sweet kiss of what could have been. A valiant effort but way of the target. Would I eat it again? Yes if free or highly discounted. Would I give it to a Thai friend as a gift. No way, they would laugh at the silliness of calling it spicy, when it clearly is not spicy in the Thai meaning of the word. If you like moist and flavorful with a nice sweetness, a whisper of Asian spices and a whimper of heat, then you'll love this Sweet and Spicy Thai Jerky from Jack Links."
5,"Christmas Tradition for Baking Each holiday season I purchase Wilton's Snowflake Sprinkle Mix -- it has become a family tradition. When I am particularly hurried the sprinkle adds a festive touch to plain bake goods like cupcakes, sheet cakes and of course, cookies. I like the mix because it is a bit different than the usual plain colored sugars and multi-colored sprinkles yet the design is clear and easy to identify. Other specialty sprinkles are sometimes too complex to create in such a small size and the result is muddled -- what are those little brown things -- gingerbread men?<br /><br />In past seasons I have included the Snowflake Sprinkle Mix in my Thanksgiving gifts to friends and family who bake to mark the approach of Christmas."
5,"Best of the best My wife loves dark chocolate.  She formerly ate only Godiva, but when that company changed form vanilla to vanillin, she no longer liked it.  She LOVES this stuff.  She says that you can taste the fresh and she doesn't want anything else."
4,"quick and easy pound cake These mixes are nice to have on hand quite easy to make I like to add a little vanilla to the basic mix to intensify the flavor  a bit.<br /> It is easy to add other ingredients  such as poppy seeds or dried fruit to make flavored pound cakes. This mix is not overly sweet and cakes come  out a bit dryer than some. All in all, it makes  a pretty decent basic cake"
1,"MSG Really? I am assuming that the company is reading these reviews so here is a tip from consumers: People shopping for dry roasted nuts and other ""healthy"" items don't want to be loaded up with MSG and other processing chemicals. Consider changing your processing methods to something a little more healthy. Go with a different brand if you are wanting to eat healthy and natural."
5,"great! When my cat had a reaction to Advantage, we realized we would have to dose her with a Capstar every 5 days. The thought of this terrified me, as my cat doesn't even like to be held for longer than ten seconds, much less have a pill shoved down her throat. I decided to try these without much hope for success, but they work like a dream! I put the pill inside the treat in a different room with the door closed, and am VERY careful not to touch the pill and treat with the same hand. My cat is pretty greedy and will eat anything, and she gobbles her pill down without even noticing! SUCH A RELIEF!!!!"
1,"Don't trust Nutricity Unfortunately, this product contains milk. There was no description (except vegetarian), i.e., no ingredients listed. The local version of this product does not contain milk, although it looks exactly the same. I cannot eat the chocolate with milk, and hence am out $40. Nutricity refused any sort of refund or credit and just gave a corporate boilerplate get-lost type response. Also, they refused to change the description of the product for future buyers to indicate the ingredients. If you don't mind milk in your dark chocolate, you might like this product, but I'd advise against buying anything from Nutricity."
1,"My mistake, but there is some good news. I didn't read the fine print...my mistake.  They should have called these Rice/Corn Chips.  Corn flour is the third ingredient so they taste more like a corn chip than a rice chip. They also have over four times more fat than a rice cracker<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETC9II"">Sesmark Rice Thins, Brown Rice, 3.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>. Now for the good news. Like many things that are not that good for you, they are really,really...good. Excellent taste and crunch.  So if you're not a health nut like me, go for it.  They're great!"
5,"Delicious! I was really impressed with this Kind bar. It tasted like an Almond Joy candy bar, but without the chocolate. I'm a chocoholic, but didn't really miss it in the bar.<br />I bought an extra box, just in case my kids started taking them. Good decision!! They are already gone, so I'm glad I have a hidden box just for me."
5,"Not a box of crap My father in law tells my daughter that cereal is a box if crap.  This cereal is not!  It's one we all love and I buy it by the case.  Great with fruit and yogurt, milk or dry."
4,"Better than expected I had already tried two Clear Scalp & Hair products and was less than impressed with the results.  In fact, I noticed a difference after just one use-and not in a good way.<br /><br />This product however was much better.  The conditioner helped restore the moisture that the Clear Scalp & Hair Moisture shampoo had striped away.  I also used the Clear Scalp & Hair Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil which added a lot of shine.<br /><br />I recommend this product to anyone with long hair (long hair is old hair-the closer to the scalp the younger the hair), curly hair or thick & coarse hair because the shea butter adds the moisture that your hair needs but it doesn't make your hair greasy or weighed down.  If you have thin or fine hair I would try a volumizing formula instead."
5,"best curry powder curry lovers search no more.  Rajah Madras Curry Powder is the best.  have been using it forever both in England and the US.  Best flavor, best heat!"
5,"YUM!! These cookies are delicious. Never heard of ""Mother's cookies"" until someone from California visited my work place. I found them at Amazon & ordered some. SOO glad I did. They are excellent."
5,Zukes Peanut Butter Mini Treats This product is my dog's absolute favorite when it comes to dog treats. I find them perfect for training... and so does she!
5,Great Flavor hard to believe it could have any nutritional value. great value and prompt delivery. intense flavor can easily be stretched to extend the value.
5,"keep on hand for sick cats This is worth always having on hand in case your cat gets sick or can't eat because of a mouth injury, cancer, etc. Also stock up on oral syringes (the 3 milliliter size works well for cats' mouths). There are 33 calories per tablespoon, and it's very syringeable with 1:1 PDG:water mix (you can make it even more concentrated and still syringe it, but it's easier for the cat at 1:1). So I add a tbsp of water to a tbsp of PDG, and this fills about three 3 milliliter syringes. I feed about 1/2 milliliter at a time with no trouble (let the cat swallow and lick in between...), so in a few minutes I can get 33 calories into the cat with no fuss. An inactive small cat only needs about 4 to 5 times that much in a day. Some cats can eat up to 2 tbsp of PDG at a time. This works well when the cat isn't even able to eat baby food meat, and even when they can - it's good to supplement them with some syringe feeding to get both of you used to it and to get cat-specific good stuff into the cat. I don't restrain the cat, just put one hand on her shoulder and put the syringe up against her teeth, then when she opens her mouth I squirt about 1/2 milliliter into her, aiming toward the back of the mouth and to the side (don't want kitty to choke...). Just be gentle and you shouldn't need to do anything more than that. You also should try the PDG/water mix in a little bowl, some cats will lick that up all by themselves. Whenever syringe feeding, it's a good idea to have easily eatable food right there also, since sometimes cats just need a little jump start with syringe feeding and then they'll eat on their own. It takes energy to eat, for one thing.<br /><br />Cats should never go more than 24 hours to 48 hours max without food- their livers aren't all that efficient and they can get very sick very quickly without food, toxins release too quickly from stored fat for the liver. Dogs and people are different, they can fast without harm. But cats can very quickly go off their feed for various reasons, even if their nose if just stuffed up from a cold (if they can't smell it, they don't want to eat it) or if they are uncomfortable for some other reason."
2,So overated I usually do not feel mislead by reviews but this is one of the few.  This is very mediocre cocoa powder but nothing mediocre about the premium price.  Not the worst thing I have had but will never get it again.
3,"Too strong for an everyday coffee My husband loves a good, full bodied cup of coffee.  His usual K-cup variety is the Coffee People's ""Wake UP"", but I thought we would try something a little stronger.  If  you want a STRONG cup of joe, the ""Jet Fuel"" is the way to go.  However, for our tastebuds, we'll stick witht the ""Wale UP"" for our every morning cup."
5,"Great take anywhere snack These are so good, and worth the money.  Everyone in your family will love this.  Good alternative to chips, or other snacky junk food."
1,YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING This price is twice what one can buy this product at the store. What gives? Nobody should consider this product at these prices.
1,Turtle soup My father was not happy with the soup. He could not eat it or my brother. I am sending it back and I don't fell that I have to pay for the shipping. It was a Birthday Gift for my Fathers 89th
5,"really good These were very good tasting and packed with honey!  Be good to have when you have a cold or a sore throat--plus, they are filled with vitamins.<br /><br />Nice alternative to cough drops!"
5,My favorite morning drink. Love this tea. What a bargain. Have been drinking it in the morning for about two years now and still enjoy it every day and look forward to it.
2,"Did NOT like the taste of these. I like all kinds of snack foods and potato chips. The regular kind, kettle cooked, and the ""modified"" potato snacks such as Munchos (my favorite) Pringles, Lay's Baked, etc.<br /><br />But not these. They have almost a styrofoam consistency...so they aren't really crisp and snappy, just hard. Like stale styrofoam. Now, I could learn to live with the texture, but the flavor is odd, too. . Almost like an unnatural type of flavor. My husband doesn't even usually notice or comment on flavors in snack foods(just sorta eats,) but he said ""I don't like these, they taste funny. Don't buy these again."" My 12 year old kids wouldn't even eat them. Maybe the ones with flavoring (like BBQ) cover it up, but not with the plain."
5,"DEEEELLIIISHHH I have to preface this by saying - I have no kids. I was just looking around for healthy organic snacks. And OH MY GOSH - these are delicious! Yes, even for adults. I nearly finished a box in a day!! Seriously if you eat one of these and then a ""goldfish"", you'll see why it's SO good - this is the way snacks are supposed to taste!!"
5,"These are a MUST!!! My dogs LOVE these Smartbones!  So much so that they sometimes turn their noses at other treats I try to give them.  These bones are a great alternative to rawhide, and Amazon & Co. have some of the lowest prices on them.  I have seen them sold for as high as $15.99 in some local stores.  The only downside is that they do not last very long, as they are so easy to chew through.  My dogs (Lab mix and Boxer mix) power through the medium and large sized bones in just a few minutes.  Still, all in all, worth the money!"
5,"Great taste Although a little crumbly, these are very tasty for a rice cake. I would definately get them again. Simple taste, but sweet enough to stave off an after lunch craving."
5,"Only the best for my Pussing Foot Kitties Petite Cuisine Chicken Pot Pie for Cats: This is an expensive bit of tomfoolery for my kitty cats. When the humans in the house get a special bit of food, the kitties do also. They are my all day companions and when the humans celebrate so do the cats.  The biggest CON for the product is the cost, which depending upon the specials in force at the time make it about a dollar a can which is 3 oz--filet migion anyone??? But on the PLUS side, the kitties lap up the entire can without the usual bits of this and that left over depending upon how well they like the daily fare. ALSO, both of my cats are male which makes them prone to urinary tract problems. In addition to pure white meat chichen, this has a watery sauce with it which they ""slurp"" right up which adds to their daily fluid intake. After reading many books on cats and kittens, I decided that these male animals needed at least half of their daily fare in ""wet food"" to avoid urinary type probs. This really helps as cats are not noted fluid imbibers unless the fluid is sauce based (or is my lemonade which they make sure to contaminate--UGH!). So I love them and spend a little extra from time to time. The humans in the house make out well too!!!! Best wishes to all and hope this helps. December 2008"
5,Great Snack The KIND dark chocolate cherry cashew bar is a great late afternoon snack to satisfy that sweet but salty craving.
5,"Very Pleased Good price, fast shipping. Good instructions with tea. Needed since I had neve drank this kind of tea before."
5,As good as buying your coffee at Tully's Tully's coffee is superior and it holds its on against Starbucks and others.  With Keurig coffee brewers you get the same quality coffee as having a cup at your local Tully's.
5,"Wonderful Color!! (first off... I planted these in the wrong area... simply not enough soil depth)<br /><br />When they finally bloomed (took a while here, we had a very bad summer for plants) they were beautiful. I loved the deep red color. Will definitely add to my sunflower garden again!"
5,"Really Great Popcorn! We have a Princeton Popper which we bought from this same company, and have owned for close to a year.<br />They are really great people giving excellent customer support, standing behind their products.<br />With that said, this popcorn is really, really great, and you don't have to have a ""popcorn machine"" to use it. You can cook it on the stove in a big tall pot like you would use for sweet corn. My only suggestion is not to put the lid on the pot but to put a mesh splatter screen over it. This will permit the vapor to escape keeping the popcorn light and fluffy and not moist.<br />This popcorn is so good you don't need to add butter either. It's fine just the way it is which is better for our health too. I have two family members that have bought Princeton machines and this popcorn because they liked ours so much, and any time friends come over for a movie or just to visit, they always ask if I would make popcorn.<br />The 8 oz. cases shipped free through Amazon really don't cost any more per oz. than you'd pay for Orville microwave in a grocery store and is hundered fold better. Ever eat left-over microwave popcorn the next day?....Yuk, it's disgusting. And you're not suppose to breath the vapor when you first open the bag fresh out of the microwave, and you want to eat that stuff? Great Northern still tastes fresh and good for days if you bag it up. After your first bag of Great Northern you'll wonder why on Earth you ever keep eating that junk from the grocery store."
1,"DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT Eeeeew <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SIY3O2"">Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Peppered, Mega Pack, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a>This order took five days to deliver and this is Florida with high humidity and high heat. Upon receipt I opened each package because I always place in my fridge in gallon zip locks. I ordered two of the mega two-packs and three of the four were fine. The fourth was FULL of mold which was visible through the packaging. I am seriously disappointed (and grossed-out). No returns/exchanges means I will NEVER purchase foods items from Amazon again.<br /><br />Update: After figuring out a way to contact Customer Service despite their policy of no returns on food items, they credited back 1/4 of total purchase price and offered free next day shipping for this item (which I will not use). Never again."
5,"Bold enough. I love chex mix. Its got more variety going for it than plain chips, and you can easily snack on it in the car, home, or quietly in an office meeting.<br /><br />The BOLD flavor of chex mix is in my top 3 favorites. On the bag it has a bottle of worcestershire, onions and garlic as the flavor profile, I can definitely taste those in this. Its not supposed to be so bold that you cannot enjoy the vehicle the flavors on are on like the pretzel, or chex, or those pumpernickel amazingness.<br /><br />I like to MIX my chex mix together. I combine BOLD with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001181MXO"">Chex Mix Chex Snack Mix - Honey Nut, 8.75-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> you should really try it, its delicious!"
5,"very gingery The ginger flavor of these cookies is intense!  Because the flavor is so strong, the serving size (5) is actually enough to satisfy.  Another great thing about the ginger snaps is the short ingredient list.  The cookies are a little hard, but nothing that a glass of milk can't solve."
5,"""Heinz means beans"" This for us and our friends is the preferred baked bean product. The taste is good, and for the health conscious, they have lower sugar than other products and are vegetarian. Please note that the US Heinz vegetarian beans (green label can) is not the same. It has no fat but is still high in sugar. Why oh why do not the US Heinz people speak with their colleagues across the Atlantic?"
4,"Dogs love them, but pieces aren't sized uniformly and they melt when wet I buy a big tub of these for my dog about every 3-4 months. He loves them. I do mix them in with other treats, so he does not get a steady diet of them. They are given out as the ""special"" treat, being one notch above a standard, wheat-free dog cookie.<br /><br />While these are great treats, they are not as ""hypnotic"" as real meat is. And, given the price, and how inexpensive some good-quality meat is at the grocery store, if you truly want to mesmerize your dog, go with real meat. Its pretty funny that so many of us are paying $7-9 for little bags of dog treats when we could be buying real beef for about $4-5 a pound.<br /><br />However, most of us don't want slimy hands all day, so we use treats. I use these out when walking my dog, and carry them when we go out backpacking or on long day hikes. I like them because they are feather light, but just don't get them wet or they turn to mush. My dog's interest in them after they get wet goes down a lot.<br /><br />I do wish the pieces were more uniformly sized, but they aren't too hard to break apart."
4,"Lots of flavor, not a lot of bad stuff These chili lime chips have only 100 calories and 4 grams of fat per bag. Most 100-cal snacks that I have had are tiny portions, but these chips are a normal sized serving.<br /><br />They aren't my favorite Pop Chip flavor, but there definetly is a lot of taste. It is strong flavor that grows on you. When I first tried them, I would have said 3 stars, but now I really like them. A few other Pop Chip fans I talked to rate them at 3 - 4 stars too.<br /><br />In the end, they are pretty not-too-bad-for-you, but the taste is, well... a matter of taste."
5,Walker Shortbreads I am constantly buying this product to use in my basket business. This is a great product to put with my hot chocolate and coffee or tea baskets. This is seller is great.
5,Great Buy I tried this grain twice at a friends house and finally decided to order some . My family all loved it so I will be a return customer.
5,"Best K-Cup, period. Tried Jet Fuel at the fire station I work at.  The stuff wired me until almost 2am (drank around 1pm).  Very strong coffee, will for sure wake you up in the AM, I pack one just in case I have a long shift! Love the taste, great product!"
3,"Ranch dressing with hot peppers My husband is the pepper eater of the family.  He said that it's nothing earth shattering...more like ranch dress with peppers.  For convenience, this can't be beat."
5,awesome substitute for peanut butter allergy! We purchased this item as a substitute for our daughter who has a peanut allergy. It even smells like peanut butter! The whole family loves this! Will definately purchase again! We are careful to tell our daughter this is SOY nut butter and NOT peanut butter~
5,"Delicious The flavor is fantastic. I tend to like my peanut butter a little thicker, so I usually use a little less water. The richness of the oil which is no longer present in this product is certainly missed when the peanut butter is forced to compete with other flavors, such as in a sandwich... but as a light topping, this product is delicious."
3,OK I don't mind the taste of this bread - but it's cakey not fluffy like wheat bread. My kids will eat it - but only toasted and warm - it crumbles very easy. I haven't found a GF bread that isn't crumbly - but out of the GF bread mixes I have tried - this is the most tasty.
4,"helps to satisfy my pho craving For a number of years I lived in Arlington TX and ate Pho several times a week at the numerous Vietnamese restaurants there. But, now I'm about two hours away from any place that serves it. So, I bought this to hopefully get my Pho fix. I had to experiment a bit, rather than exactly follow the recipe on the box, but you can achieve a reasonable substitute for restaurant Pho with this product.<br /><br />Different people will have different preferences, but here's how I've been using Happy Pho. Since I like beef better than chicken, and more broth than noodles, my stock is made from 6 cups of water with 3 chicken and 2 beef bouillon cubes per Pho spice packet (instead of the suggested 4 cups of chicken broth). Then, I only use 1/2 to 2/3 of a package of the brown rice noodles. For meat, I toss in about 8 pre-cooked frozen beef meatballs and several beef cold cuts.<br /><br />I do follow the recipe on the amount of cilantro and ginger, but also add a couple of chopped up green onions. After that's all combined and cooked, serve it with spinach leaves, bean sprouts, and chopped up fresh serrano peppers on the side. I always add quite a lot of sriracha sauce, because I like the soup hot and spicy. (This also helps if you think you used too much broth for the amount of Pho flavoring provided.) Some hoisin sauce can be good, too.<br /><br />This works pretty well for me until I can travel somewhere a more authentic version of the dish is served. I have also tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PBM598"">VV Foods Vietnamese Beef Pho Noodle Soup Spice, 1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)</a>, which is another decent variation on the Pho spices - you get 3 spice packets per box. The same recipe above seems good with this product, as well, other than you may need an extra cup or more of broth."
5,"Excellent chocolate milk substitute I bought 4 cases of these back in June based on all the 5 star reviews. I'm now about to order 4 more. I have lost 35+ pounds since mid-June and this drink has been a small part of that. The taste is so good that I haven't craved (or missed) regular chocolate milk at all. Typically I make one bottle last for 2-3 servings. You don't need a lot to satisfy your chocolate craving. Just give it a shake, open and enjoy. I hope they never change the recipe for this. I'm hooked."
1,"Rockstar Juiced is a joke now! I used to buy these everyday! [sometimes twice], but since they changed the contents to merely water and artificial crap! I dont buy at all!!!They taste terrible now............ WHERE'S THE JUICE !"
5,"Toast in a dry skillet; make with coffee and cream Coach's Oats' patented procedures produce some very well-textured oatmeal--the best I've had.<br /><br />Here's my method of preparing them:<br />Toast ~1.5 Cups raw Coach's Oats in a dry stainless-steel medium pot. Add ~3/4 tsp of Kosher Salt.<br />Add 3 Tbsp of Coconut Oil and/or Macadamia Oil and/or Butter. Stir until toasted and brown.<br />In a separate container, microwave 3 cups of water and 1 cup of black coffee to a boil (4 cups total).<br />Pour the boiling liquid over the oats in the hot cooking vessel. Instant violent boil. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes.<br />Remove lid and stir in cinnamon (e.g. cassia) and ~4 Tbsp Orange Blossom Honey.<br />Simmer uncovered for ~4 more minutes until desired texture consistency is reached. I like mine on the drier side.<br />Serve with a splash of cream and/or berries. Or anything that will stand up to the coffee flavor. Have fun."
4,"Vigo Octopus is tasty Octopus in Olive oil tastes great. Vigo has been using bigger pieces which is good but not as good as the little tentacles they once used. I rip open the can and have instant lunch. My buddies think it's a bit weird, but I love it."
3,"Not my favorite! Upon opening the bag, I noticed smell was somewhat on the spicy side not sweet enough for us. Higher acidity level comes out in the flavor leaving a bitter after taste. Better than grocery store coffee though!"
4,Good product This mask smells amazing and does clean my face well.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it did dry out some parts of my already dry skin!  I don't think I would purchase this particular one again but definitely would try another Alba mask.  I LOVE ALBA!!
5,"Great Product! I have several friends and family members with food allergies (gluten, dairy) which effect their ability to eat delicious desserts.  When I found this syrup I jumped on the chance to get them some.  It turned out to be a big hit!  Goes great on ice cream.  I tried it and can safely say that it's delicious whether you have allergies or not!"
5,"Amazing! Bust out the napkins, grab yourself a beer, and buckle your seat belts cause this stuff is a proper<br />authentic flamefest of Jamaican jerk heat. You can put it on straight, or cut it with a little olive<br />oil, but I've found it best to marinate chicken or pork tenderloins for at least 24 hours before cooking for optimum results.<br /><br />Its a little messy cause you really have to rub this stuff in and make sure you turn/shake your marinade bag every few hour to ensure an even distribution of this wondermous stuff. If you're not using rubber gloves, make sure you wash your hands and I wouldn't plan on rubbing your eyes or doing anything else to sensitive body parts for a while. haw haw<br /><br />This stuff is the best, followed closely by Grace Jerk Seasoning but Walkerswood doesn't turn your chicken green like the Grace rub does. 5 Pods"
4,"Best Instant Miso But I love this soup it is the best tasting instant miso, except it has MSG added that is the only bad thing about it. If Kikkoman would take that ingredient out it would be almost perfect for instant miso."
5,"UNSALTED ROASTED NUTS This is one of the best nut products available today. The local stores stopped carrying them; so my next step was to do grocery shopping online. I found these at Amazon, for a good price, and they showed up quickly. My wife uses these nuts as a dietary supplement with Nutrisystem. She was very surprised when I ""found"" them again.<br /><br />They are tasty nuts with ""no salt"". Great."
5,"Really Light Cookie If you are looking for a sweet, try this cookie.  It is extra light<br />and has a nice crunch to it.  I buy these cookies by the carton.<br />They last for one month between my husband and I.  He likes cookies<br />with his morning coffee.

5,Good product to have Very good product.  Shipping was acceptable.  Product came in a good size.  Enough for any personal items or gifts you may want to make.
5,"Regular pasta with 1/2 the carbs We have tried soy pasta and wheat pasta as ""healthy"" alternatives to conventional pasta. Soy is horrible, horrible, horrible. Wheat is funky. This pasta is a wonderful alternative. It tastes like regular pasta but gives 19 grams of starches/sugars per serving as opposed to 41 grams with conventional pasta. Even without being on any special diet, we figure, ""Why put all tha extra starch/sugar into our bodies, not to mention the bodies of our children and grandchildren?"" Anywhere we can cut down on starch/sugar intake is, in my opinion, good."
3,"Moravian Meyer Lemon Cookies These cookies have a great, lemony taste.  The only bad thing was that they're thin and many of them were broken."
5,"Pink Pig I love this! Delicious with strawberry! I mix this with milk and coffee, it is good for morning. I just cannot help eating more!"

5,recent purchase Hoping this new dog food will have amazing results with my dogs. I like the list of ingredients and they seem to like the taste.
1,"Not same as Grandma's! I ordered this product from Amazon because we are not able to find the original Cream of Wheat in local stores. Apparently the manufacturer drastically modified the product but left the packaging the same. I ordered this based on the reviews. Don't believe it! The flavor, consistency, aroma -- all different. It clumps up as soon as you put it the liquid. Impossible to get smooth. This is what I imagine baby pablum tastes like. NOT ORIGINAL, someone should sue the manufacturer for false advertising!"
3,"good flavor, weak coffee I like my coffee stronger, but the over all flavor of this is good. I will probably buy it again next fall."
4,"Tortillas by Porkyland 10"" The product was delivered in a timely manner. The tortillas have a good bread taste and the color is just slightly off white. It isn't quite like the ones I used to get in the store but it is a good product."
2,"Weak & watery - where is the coffee & hazelnut flavor? I see that some reviewers also noted very weak coffee with these, yet some rave about it. I've only tried one box of the GJ's Hazelnut (won't be ordering more). We've bought other Gloria Jean's which are good, such as the Butter Toffee. So, it may be a quality control issue and you may or may not have good luck w/ Hazelnut. I cannot even detect Hazelnut flavor by taste nor a good hazelnut fragrance as this brews (unusual with flavored coffee k-cups). I've tried various sizes - even the small cup setting doesn't produce a flavorful coffee."
